1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
我会记得人们常说我们转向第一人称
I will remember people often often said that we move to first person

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,750
因为这更容易，因为我们看不到玩家角色
Because it's easier because we don't see player characters

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,540
只是说你是否会看到我们在《巫师》中的图表
just say if you would see the graphs that we had in witcher

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,280
以及赛博朋克中的图表
And the graphs that we have in cyberpunk

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,120
没有十倍大的
There are no ten times bigger

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,680
嗨，我是。迈克尔，欢迎来到频道故事模式

00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,440
今天我们正在玩《赛博朋克二十七十七》的几个早期任务
today we are playing through a couple early missions of cyber punk twenty seventy seven

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,390
并讨论以完全第一人称视角制作游戏所带来的独特的讲故事挑战
And discussing the unique storytelling challenges that come with doing a game in a entirely first person perspective

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,120
我加入了故事模式团队的一部分 alex coyotes 你好

就像，是的

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,330

我肯定会接受的
I will take that for sure

26
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,450
一
Um

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:12,710
好的
Okay

28
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,300
所以我真的很高兴能和你们谈论，呃
So i'm really excited to talk to you guys about , uh

29
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,750
我们要涉及的所有事情因为我
All the things we're gonna get into because i

30
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,850
你知道，我记得启动赛博朋克
You know , i remember booting up cyberpunk

31
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,950
我清理了我的日程安排
I cleared my schedule

32
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,782
整个故事我读得很开心
I had so much fun going through the whole story

33
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:26,400
并进入游戏
And going into the game

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,510
我当时有点
I was a little

35
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,620
呃，担心是因为我没玩过那么多第一人称RPG
Uh , concern because i hadn't played that many first person rpg

36
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,540
大部分都是像第三人称那样做的
Had mostly done like the third person thing

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,290
所以我很好奇如何
So i was very curious about how

38
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,610
那次经历会是什么样子
What that experience was going to look like

39
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,790
以及所有这些讲故事的时刻将如何完成
And how all those storytelling moments were going to be done

40
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,060
我对第一人称的承诺感到非常震惊
And i was just super blown away by the commitment to the first person

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,720
以及所有不同的技术
and all the different techniques

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,350
你们过去常常用电影的方式讲故事
You guys used to tell a story in a cinematic way

43
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,370
你知道，不使用传统的电影语言
Without using , you know , conventional cinematic language

44
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,410
而且，你知道，相机可以剪辑以及诸如此类的东西
And , you know , the camera can cut and all that stuff

45
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,900
所以
So

46
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,200
一会儿我们要去看《巫师三》
And a moment we're gonna go to the witcher three

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,340
看看其中的一个场景来识别
and kind of look at a scene from that to identify

48
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,060
其中一些常规的
What some of those conventional

49
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,180
呃，讲故事的语言是这样的
Uh , storytelling language things are

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,199
但我只是想听听你们的消息
But i kind of just want to hear from you guys for

51
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,102
对于那些可能不知道什么的人
For people that might not know what

52
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:11,930
你的工作包括什么
What does your job entail

53
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,930
你在赛博朋克中负责什么
What are you responsible for in cyberpunk

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,340
好的
Okay

55
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:17,940
一
Um

56
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,880
嗯，这是一个，你知道这是一个很好的问题
Well , that's a that's , you know that's that's a great question

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,580
呃
Uh

58
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,880
因为我们有这个问题需要正确解释
Because we have that problem to explain properly

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,320
我们很多时间都在做什么
What we do a lot of time

60
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,370
呃，在我们部门，我们经常这样问自己
Uh , often we ask ourselves that , uh , in our department

61
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,650
还有像最近这样的
And of like recently

62
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,920
我们做了完整的演示
And we made our full blown presentation

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
如何向奶奶解释
How to explain to a grandmother

64
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,860
电影设计师是做什么的，对吧
What does cinematic designer does , right

65
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,600
这是一个问题，呃
This is a problem , uh

66
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,230
我觉得大部分都是这些
I think most of these

67
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,580
我们正在指导游戏中的叙事内容
We are directing the narratic content in our games

68
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,930
所以我们对它的外观负责
So we are responsible for how it looks

69
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,450
感觉如何。最后
How it feels . and in the end

70
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,300
当玩家实际浏览我们创建的内容时它是如何播放的
How it plays when player actually goes through the content that we created

71
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,670
呃，从我的角度来看
Uh , from my perspective

72
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,380
通常只是将东西放在一起
It's often about just putting stuff together

73
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,300
所以基本上导演在电影中所做的除了这里的例外
so basically what the director does in the movies with this exception that here

74
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,150
您还实现了游戏元素并考虑了交互性
You also implemented and take the interactivity into account the gameplay elements

75
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,210
等等
And so on

76
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,930
一
Um

77
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,320
所以这就像你有不同的部门一起工作
So it's about like you have different departments working together

78
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,400
任务故事的环境视觉特效
Environment vfx out the quest story

79
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,510
等等 。因为电影设计师就处于其中
And so on . as the cinematic designer are kind of in the middle of it

80
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,800
并尝试使所有元素相互契合
And try to make all elements fit into each other

81
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
所以就像，你知道，场景很悲伤
So like , you know , the scene is sad

82
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,480
突然之间你就没有播放愉快的音乐了
And suddenly you don't have a happy music playing or something

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,230
仍然是，呃，这是一个简单的例子
It's still , uh , it's a simple example

84
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,440
但大多数时候只是将事物连接在一起
But most of the time is just about connecting things together

85
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,270
是的
Yeah

86
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,010
惊人的
Awesome

87
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,410
凉爽的
Cool

88
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:36,790
好的
Okay

89
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,110
出色地
Well

90
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,370
是的
Yeah

91
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,090
所以我们要看看《巫师三》中的场景
So we're gonna look at it scene from the witcher three

92
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,250
你能不能
And can you kind of

93
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,092
呃，当我们正在看的时候
Uh , as we're watching it

94
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:47,080
列出一些用于该类型的工具的名称
Name some of the tools that are used in that kind of

95
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,040
你知道，电影式的讲故事必须是，呃
You know , cinematic storytelling that had to be , uh

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,610
为赛博朋克而改变或重新思考
Changed or rethought for a cyber punk

97
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,230
但是你为什么要启动呢，这三个
But so why do you want to startup , which were three

98
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,030
是的
And yeah

99
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,767
你们解释一下
You guys sort of explain

100
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:02,730
这个场景中讲故事的方式是怎样的
What's going on storytelling wise in this scene

101
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,740
呵呵，酷
Hh , cool

102
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,880
其实这就是我拍的场景，我记得
Actually it's the scene i did , i remember

103
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,065
一
Um

104
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:07,560
是的
Yeah

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,500
所以，嗯，与猎魔人
So , um , with the witcher

106
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,160
我想，嗯，也是因为这是我们类似公式中的第三款游戏
I think , um , also because it's our third game in the similar formula

107
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,109
而且，嗯，基于当时制作的许多类似游戏的文件
And , um , based les on many similar games done at the time

108
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,290
嗯，游戏玩法之间的区别非常明显
Um , you have a pretty clear distinction between gameplay

109
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,030
就像故事的节拍一样
And like the story beats

110
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,270
当然，我们假设它不像零一
Let's say it's not like zero one , of course

111
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,960
就像它融合在不同的杠杆中一样
And like it blends in different levers

112
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,080
但基本上你会探索你的跑步
But basically you explore your run

113
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,320
你需要努力点击一些东西
You fight to click some things

114
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,600
然后当你想告诉你一个故事时
And then when you we want to tell you a story

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,480
然后我们进入电影级电影模式
Then we go into the cinematic ucinematic mode

116
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,110
而且，嗯，这样
And , um , in this way

117
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,730
这是一个非常经典的主题故事
It's a pretty classical thematic storytelling

118
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,300
所以你的相机镜头只显示你
So you have the camera shots that show you only

119
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,580
我们想在任何特定时刻向您展示什么
What we want to show you at any given moment

120
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,860
就像相机放在这里一样
So like camera goes here

121
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,620
镜头转到这里，镜头切回来
Camera goes here , camera cuts back

122
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,260
依此类推，有一个编辑
And so on there's an edit

123
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,062
当然
Of course

124
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:57,370
我们在场景中安排角色，嗯
We stage characters around the scene , um

125
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,600
但就像与编辑一起，我们可以传送它们
But like together with the edits , we can teleport them

126
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,570
事实上，如果你用静态外部摄像头在冬天观看这些场景中的任何一个
And actually , if you look at any of those scenes in the winter from like static external camera

127
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,010
您只会看到像在之间弹出的字符
You would see just characters like popping between

128
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,380
一直喜欢场景中的不同地方
Like different places in the scene all the time

129
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,190
但从玩家角度来看
But from the player perspective

130
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,510
它们无法在相机本身中接收
They cannot receiit in the camera itself

131
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,450
因为它就像，你知道，一些模糊的背景，例如，或者其他什么
Because it's just like , you know , some blurried background , for example , or something

132
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,110
对于我们来说，它给了我们创作的自由
And for us , it gives us like the creative freedom

133
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,910
比如说与背景形成完美的构图。等等
Let's say to make a perfect composition with the background . and so on

134
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,250
玩家通常不会看到角色移动了两米夏天
Players usually don't see that the characters moved like by two meters summer

135
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,600
因为有时也没有直接的参考点
Because also sometimes there are no direct points of reference

136
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
一
Um

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,470
所以，呃，演技方面就是这样
So , uh , that was it in terms of acting

138
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,580
我们主要是在混合，嗯
We were mostly mixing , um

139
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,550
呃，自定义独特的资产，比如最大的过场动画和你只看到一次的东西
Uh , custom unique assets for like the biggest cut scenes and stuff that you see only once

140
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,700
这正是故事的时刻
And it's exactly for the story moment

141
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,930
实际上有一个巨大的动画库，我们可以以多种不同的创意方式重用它们
With actually a huge library of animations that we could reuse in many different creative ways

142
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,390
就像拉伸动画一样
Like stretch animations

143
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,430
剪切它们，与其他动画混合
Cut them , blend with other animations

144
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,640
与更多动画等混合
Blend with more animations and so on

145
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,620
你会惊讶于游戏中的某些时刻
And you would be surprised like there are moments in the game where

146
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,770
哪些就像伸手去拿东西
Which are is like reaching for something

147
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,940
握住它并传递给某人
And holding it and passing into someone

148
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,140
但实际上我们从只用一只手演奏的喝酒动画拼凑而成
But actually we put together from the animation of drinking played only on a hand

149
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,610
还有上半身打开的动画什么的
And the animation of turning on the upper body and something

150
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,210
最后在相机里
And in the end in the camera

151
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,330
看起来他真的在做这件事
Kind of looks like he's really doing this

152
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,840
但对我们来说，这确实是一个好方法
But for us it was a really like a good way of for

153
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,930
就像节省录制所有自定义内容的时间一样
So like saving time on recording everything custom

154
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,770
就像能够在许多不同的级别上操纵动画一样
Just like being able to manipulate animations in many different levels

155
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,720
一
Um

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,930
呃，得到什么
Uh , get or something

157
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,390
是的
Yeah

158
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,890
我不是，也许我没有忘记
I'm not , not forget maybe

159
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,670
但我认为是这样
But i think it's it's

160
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:40,220
重要的是要记住我们实际上使用了普通电影所做的一切，对吧
It's very important to remember that we actually use everything that normal movies do , right

161
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,380
所以我们将编辑，我们使用摄像机
So we will edit , we use cam camera

162
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,480
我们使用，呃，角色移动，呃
We use , uh , character movement , uh

163
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,660
甚至从伊戈尔所说的各种简单的事情来看，非常简单的动画
And even from the various simple things like igor said , very simple animations

164
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,960
你可以得到玩家的这种情绪反应
You can get this emotional response for the player

165
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,900
因为玩家会观察动作并且能够对动作产生共鸣，对吗？
Because the player observes the action and can empathize with the action , right

166
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,900
这样他们就能理解角色内心深处的感受
So they can understand what the characters are feeling deep inside

167
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,225
我们用所有这些来讲述最好、最感人的故事
And we use all of that to tell the best , most moving stories possible

168
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,800
尽管我们使用的是非常基本的，呃
Even though we are using very basic , uh

169
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,370
你知道，就像制作工具的一百年一样，顶部还点缀着互动功能，对吧？
You know , like one hundred year in the making tools with the sprinkled interactivity on the top , right

170
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,430
所以在选择的时刻会玩centipeak并选择
So during the choice moments will play centipeak and choose

171
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,872
他们想要故事的哪个分支
Which branch of the story they want to take

172
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:21,540
嗯嗯
Uh huh

173
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:21,780
呃
Uh

174
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,020
是的
Yeah

175
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,740
这里实际上是你刚刚关闭的场景
Here actually the scenes you just shut

176
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,820
这正是与巴罗诺斯的场景
This was exactly does the scene with baronos

177
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
主要是在像库动画一样的起床上完成的
Mostly done on like library animations is getting up

178
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,040
转动一个简单的东西
Turning a simple stuff

179
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,420
然后一个是 sii Siri 穿过森林
And then one is sii siri running through the forest

180
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,190
现在她需要，嗯
And now she needs , um

181
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,230
呃，在树枝下什么的
Uh , under the , under the branch or something

182
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,990
这完全就像一个定制的时刻
It's totally like a custom moment

183
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,170
就，就一次，就你，呃，就这个
Just , just once , just u , uh , just this

184
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,630
是的
Yeah

185
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,210
是的
Yeah

186
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,750
所以是的
And so yeah

187
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,310
我完全喜欢你所说的
I like exactly what you said

188
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:52,030
他们的目的是，总结一下，你正在使用大约四百年来电影中的所有工具
They're pol to , to kind of summarize that you're using all the tools from film that have been around four hundred years

189
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,150
就像你说的自我
Like you were saying ego

190
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,920
您可以让摄像机准确地显示玩家
You can have the camera show the player exactly

191
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,160
您希望他们在任何特定时刻看到的内容
What you want them to see at any given moment

192
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,400
你知道，你可以剪两个特写
You know , you can cut two closeups

193
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,730
你可以移动镜头来强调，嗯
You can do camera moves to accentuate , um

194
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,870
你知道，情感和压缩的时间
You know , emotion and compressed time

195
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,150
你知道，就像你说的，你就像在幕后一样
And you know , like you were saying you go like behind the scenes

196
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,710
角色们到处跳来跳去
The characters are jumping around and all

197
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,850
电影场景中发生的所有事情
All the stuff that's what's happening on a movie set

198
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,270
是的
Yeah

199
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,790
正确的
Right

200
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,710
都是假的
It's all fake

201
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,450
是的
Yeah

202
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,397
是的
Yeah

203
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,020
呃
Uh

204
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,400
所以是的
So yeah

205
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,900
所以你在《巫师三》中拥有所有这些工具
So you have all those tools in the witcher three

206
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,920
这就是传统的电影叙事方式
And that's kind of conventional cinematic storytelling

207
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,680
那么为什么，为什么我们不跳进去，呃
So why , why don't we jump into , uh

208
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,600
网络朋克和想谈谈基本上
Cyber punk and wanna talk about basically

209
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,745
你们如何获得同样的情感
How you guys achieve the same kind of emotions

210
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:35,520
呃，没有那些工具或者类似的修改所有这些东西
Uh , without those tools or like by modifying all those things

211
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,689
但也许让我们从类似开始
But maybe let's start with just like

212
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:41,310
背后是什么样的决策
What was the kind of decision making behind

213
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,010
首先以第一人称视角进行赛博朋克
Doing cyber punk in first person perspective to begin with

214
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,060
啊，当然
Ah , sure

215
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,830
所以对我来说，这就像两个
So for me , these were like two

216
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,190
我们从以下角度来说一下这个决定的方向
Let's say directions for this decision from the point of view

217
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,680
让我们以某种方式说创造者和创造
Let's say creator and creation in a way

218
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,350
所以从创作者的角度来看，就像这样
So from the creator point of view , like this

219
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,830
这是公式，经典的电影公式
Which are formula , the classic cinematic formula

220
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,750
我我感觉我们
I i felt like we

221
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,100
我们在某种程度上将这个公式推向了极限
We have pushed this formula to the limit in a way

222
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,400
就像我们可以让它变得更好一样
Like we could make it may be better

223
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,560
但不会有所不同
But it won't be different

224
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
这就像一个定量的
It would be just like a quantative

225
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,280
不是真正的定性，就像某种意义上的变化
Not really qualitative , like change in a way

226
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
所以我想在工作室
So i think at the studio

227
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,420
这对我们有好处
It was good for us

228
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,830
呃
Uh

229
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,460
所以就像现在尝试一些东西
So just like now try something

230
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,980
你知道，做点别的事，比如开发，呃
You know , do something else , like develop , uh

231
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,672
你知道，尝试一下
You know , try to

232
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:24,210
是的
Yeah

233
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,510
第一次做某事
Do something for the first time

234
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,050
而不是停留在同一个公式中，呃
Instead of staying in the same formula , uh

235
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,310
但其实没那么重要
But it's actually less important

236
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,530
我认为更重要的永远是
I think the more important is always like

237
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,480
您尝试将形式与功能相匹配
You try to match the form with the function

238
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,620
嗯，在某种程度上
Um , in a way

239
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,260
还有，嗯，赛博朋克
And , um , cyber punk

240
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,640
实际上我们可以像我一样破坏一下游戏吗
And actually can we spoil the game a little bit like i

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,940
我们不会玩任务
We won't be playing quest

242
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,160
但只有一点点剧透
But just a little bit of spoilers

243
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,020
没关系
It's fine

244
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,060
我正值那个时候
I'm time of that

245
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,440
是的
Yeah

246
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,740
是的
Yeah

247
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,720
嗯，对吧
Um , right

248
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,440
所以在比赛的第一个大转折点
So at the first big turning point of the game

249
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
事实证明，你不仅快要死了，而且很快就会死
Like it turns out that not only you are dying and you will die soon

250
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,320
但你脑子里也有另一个人
But also you have this other person in your head

251
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,500
而这两种经历
And both of those experiences

252
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,160
让我们说一下，呃，类似的经历，呃
Let's say the , uh , experience of like , uh

253
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,520
你的身体有些腐烂
Your body decaying somewhat

254
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,020
就像，你知道，你被困在身体里的死亡，呃
And like , you know , the mortality of the body you are trapped inside , uh

255
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,360
还有超主观的
As well as the super subjective

256
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
想象一下看到你身边的另一个人
Think of like seeing that other person in your

257
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,500
呃，在你的脑海里
Uh , in your head

258
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,590
这是一个非常主观的事情，fbp 觉得讲述一个非常主观的事情是正确的选择
It's something that is so subjective that fbp felt like the right choice to tell a very

259
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,170
非常主观的故事
Very subjective story

260
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,290
另外，呃
And in addition , uh

261
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,690
我认为有类似的比喻，嗯，嗯，嗯
I think there's like trope , um , of , um

262
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:37,100
这与像这个凡人监狱一样的身体和技术的网络朋克一起工作，作为一种喜欢的方式
That works with cyber punk of like body as this smortal prison and technology as a way to like

263
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,300
你知道，释放你自己或者以某种方式同意，你知道，这个，这个，这个身体
You know , free yourself or somehow assent from , you know , this , this , this body

264
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,760
这也适用于 , 对于游戏
And this also works like for , for the game

265
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,460
现在如果你有 fbp
And now if you would have fbp

266
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,980
这将与第三人称场景混合在一起
That would be mixed with third person scenes

267
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,770
它并没有真正给你
It kind of doesn't really give you

268
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,880
这种感觉就像被囚禁一样，你无法真正摆脱它
This feeling of like imprisonment in a way that you cannot really get out of it

269
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,700
就好像是的
It's like yeah

270
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,820
你被困在他的身体里
You are trapped in his body

271
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,560
死亡等
Dying and so on

272
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,200
但这实际上就像是别人的外部观点
But here is like an external point of view actually of someone else

273
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,900
喜欢第三人称场景
Like the third person scene

274
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,860
它会像这样工作
It would work like this

275
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,580
它是
It's

276
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,080
是的
Yeah

277
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,340
外面还有
There's the outside

278
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,980
也许她看到了更悲伤的角色
And maybe she sees the sader character

279
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,860
但作为相机我是谁
But who am i done as a camera

280
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,380
喜欢从什么角度看
like from what perspective

281
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,680
我正在看这个。等等
I am watching this . and so on

282
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,960
所以对于这个故事来说，这感觉是一个非常正确的选择
So it felt like a really right choice for this exact story

283
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,822
嗯
嗯

284
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:23,230
是的
Yeah

285
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,760
我想，呃，这就是我的解释
That would be , i think , uh , my explanation

286
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,990
因为到最后
Because at the end of the day

287
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,890
我们想讲最好的故事，对吗？
We want to tell the best stories , right

288
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,470
我们通常会根据想要讲述的故事来选择工具
And often we pick the tools based on the stories want to tell

289
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,700
就像你的设定一样
So like in your set

290
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,540
我们非常想告诉这个，呃
We want to tell this very , uh

291
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,240
关于我们扮演的人是谁的主观故事。到底
Subjective story about who the person that we are playing is . in the end

292
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,530
我们可以在游戏一开始就定义它们
We can define , define them at the very beginning of the game somewhat

293
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,130
但我们有一个非常特别的故事要讲
But we have a very particular story to tell

294
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,610
我们认为这是真正实现这一目标的最佳方式，对吗？
And we felt that this is the best way to actually approach it , right

295
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,480
拥有如此多的互动性
To have this amount of interactivity

296
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,420
不仅在世界上
Not only in the world

297
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,700
但也从演示的角度来看
But also from the presentation standpoint

298
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,375
因为到最后
Because at the end of the day

299
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,220
当你确实有一些东西离相机很近时，你就可以
When you actually have something very close to the camera , you well

300
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,680
你可以看到最好的
You can see the best you can

301
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,160
你可以，你可以体验这个亲密小故事的最好版本
You can , you can experience the best possible version of this small intimate story

302
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,710
呃
Uh

303
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,910
所以我想注意
So i would like to note

304
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,350
注意一些狂野的，呃
Note some the wild , uh

305
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,900
第二次前实际上是在和詹金斯交谈
Second ago was actually talking with jenkins

306
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,340
我想指出的是，jenki 的头部是按照 eager 建模的
And i would like to note that jenki's head was modeled after eager

307
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,030
所以你实际上有正确的 h
So you actually have the correct h

308
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,100
不不不，那是，正在通话中
No , no , that was , that was on the call

309
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,760
正在通话中
It was on the call

310
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,350
为什么你会在一分钟后在现实生活中与你交谈
Why it you're you're gonna talk to in real life in a minute

311
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,800
是的
Yeah

312
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,240
因为他和你有过一次全息手术
Because he had a holocaular with with you

313
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,320
哦，这
Oh thris

314
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,560
是的
Yeah

315
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:29,840
是的
Yeah

316
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,120
是的
Yeah

317
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,160
是的
Yeah

318
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,800
一
Um

319
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,410
所以，你知道，网络故事
So , you know , internet story

320
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,230
正如你所看到的，就像
And as you can see , like the

321
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,270
，视角的接近性在这里有帮助
The , the closeness of the perspective helps here

322
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:37,760
正确的
Right

323
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,850
嗯嗯
Uh huh

324
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,280
出色地
Well

325
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,530
你知道，我在想我们正在看哪三个
You know , i was thinking about we were watching which are three

326
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,360
你知道，迈克尔对所有这些技术都很熟悉
You know , i all those technies are so familiar to michael

327
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
而我作为有电影背景的人
And i as people with a film background

328
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,467
你知道这个，哦，这是一个移动镜头，这是一个从肩膀上反向拍摄的镜头
You know this , oh , it's a dolly shot here's this shot reverse shot over the shoulder

329
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:54,930
这让我觉得这是虚拟现实的语言
And this strikes me as the language of virtual reality

330
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,730
这是，这是你们几乎要致力于一件事
This is , this is you guys are committing almost to a thing

331
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,020
这只有在虚拟中才有可能，嗯
That is only possible in that virtual , um

332
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,180
第一人称视角空间
First person perspective space

333
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,920
所以你在某种程度上做出了可能喜欢的贡献
so you're kind of contributing in a way to like potentially

334
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,460
随着虚拟现实变得越来越多，我们将探索一种未来的电影语言
A future cinematic language that we're gonna be exploring as virtual reality becomes more and more

335
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,060
呃
Uh

336
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,012
你知道，这是一种通用的讲故事方式
You know , a universal kind of way to tell stories

337
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:21,070
嗯，你确实触及了一个巨大的话题
Well , you touched upon gigantic subject that's for sure

338
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,350
我们可能只能谈论一个小时
We could probably talk about an hour only about this

339
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,790
因为我同意你的观点
Because i agree with you

340
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,890
我们正处于这中间的某个地方
We are somewhere in the middle of this

341
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,010
你知道，完全虚拟现实体验
You know , fully vr experience

342
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,370
还有这种经典的电影体验，对吧
And this classical cinematic experience , right

343
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,120
因为我们实际上只是介于两者之间
Because we actually are but kind of in the between of them

344
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,790
一
Um

345
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,990
当我们开始研究弗兰克说时
And when we started working on sayer frank

346
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,200
我们分析了过去二十年的第一人称游戏体验
We analyzed the last twenty years of first person experiences in games

347
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,780
我们知道，我们研究了一些有效的方法和一些无效的方法
And we know we , we looked at some things that worked and someone that didn't

348
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,880
我们最终得出了这个独特的结论
And we ended up in this unique take

349
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,970
我觉得这实际上同时推动了多个方向的界限
I feel that actually pushes the boundaries in multiple directions at once

350
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,070
因为但最终
Because but at the end of the day

351
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,990
我们在这里以前所未有的方式命名未知领域
We are naming uncharted territors here , like no one

352
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,745
我我我不知道其他设计实际上采用了这个
I , i , i don't know other design actually took this

353
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:05,930
整个故事的这种处理方式就像完整的故事结束了，你知道，二十，四十
This approach to the whole like full blown story over , you know , twenty , forty

354
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,142
在这里可以实际体验的五十个小时
Fifty hours that you can actually experience here

355
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:11,240
这实际上具有极高的分支保真度
That actually has branching extremely high fidelity

356
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,257
可定制的角色
Customizable characters

357
00:14:13,257 --> 00:14:17,230
啊，这是，这是一个非常复杂的想法
Ah , it's , it's a very complex idea

358
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,730
但最后我觉得是的
But in the end , i feel that yeah

359
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,690
我们实际上在这里做了一些非常特别的事情
We actually done something very special here

360
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,690
一
Um

361
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,050
是的
Yeah

362
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,370
我喜欢看比赛
I like i'm looking at the game

363
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,250
因为我真的很想开始谈论游戏了
Because i really want to start talking about the game already

364
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,130
就像很多事情一样，比如过去的事情
Like so many things like when went past , for example

365
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,080
我们如何从特写镜头开始
How we start with a close up shot

366
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,550
呃
Uh

367
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,490
感觉真的很像
Which felt was really like

368
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,570
呃，对我们有感觉
Uh , felt for us

369
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,590
与你的角色建立这种个人联系非常重要
Was really important to set up this personal connection with your character

370
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,570
在游戏中更是如此
Even more so in a game that's about

371
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,870
就像你定制你的角色一样
Like you customize your character

372
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,650
然后你就可以在游戏中真正看到这个角色并说
And then you can really see this character during the game and say

373
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,450
来吧，就像我们说的那样
Come on , like let's say remark

374
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,850
我们上网
We get on the , on the internet

375
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,510
所以至少在一开始就以某种方式将你与这个，呃，角色联系起来
So at least at the beginning to tie you somehow with this , uh , character

376
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,370
而且它的工作原理就像是在相对括号中说的
And also it works is like it let's say in a rative bracket

377
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,310
因为游戏是从穿上衣服开始的
Because the game starts with the clothes up

378
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,270
最后把衣服穿好，呃，还有
And ends with the clothes up , uh , as well

379
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,690
就像一种类似的封闭
Just as a kind of like closure to the

380
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,890
嗯，讲故事吧，嗯
Um , to the story , um

381
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,190
无论如何，嗯，就喜欢而言
Anyway , um , in terms of like

382
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,680
也许让我们更详细地了解我们如何处理这个问题
Maybe let's go into more details about how we approach this

383
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,980
例如，一件事
so for example , one thing

384
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,280
我想我希望场景中已经能感受到这一点
and i think i hope it can be already felt in the scene

385
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,570
现在玩的时候
While playing right now

386
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:22,700
我们的基本假设之一是我们希望玩家成为场景中的演员
Is one of our base assumptions was that we want the player to be an actor in a scene

387
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,160
实际上并不喜欢重播其他角色
And not actually like replaying other character

388
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,220
尽管 。当然你总是有限制的
Though . of course you always have limits of

389
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,060
您可以允许玩家做什么
What you can like allow player to do of

390
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,180
因为很多原因
Because of many reasons

391
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,080
就像，你知道，制作以及我们想要如何推动故事一样
Just like , you know , production and how we want to drive the story

392
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,960
一
Um

393
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,150
但我们一直想要，呃
But we always wanted to the , uh

394
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,070
扮演场景中呃，呃，演员的玩家
The player to be the u , uh , actor in the scene

395
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,340
所以让玩家在场景中实际做事而不是观看它们
So for the player to actually do things in the scene instead of watching them

396
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,660
所以我们是故意的，例如这里
So we on purpose , for example here

397
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,250
就像詹金斯从办公桌上站起来走到另一个地方时一样
Like when jenkins gets up from his desk and walks to another place

398
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,350
我们想向您展示，在此期间苏也移动
We want to show you that during this su also move

399
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,190
你实际上可以进行这样的对话
and you could actually have this conversation

400
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,022
而依然坐在书桌旁的椅子上。这是你的选择
While still sitting on the chair by the desk . it's your choice

401
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:02,100
就像你可以这样表达自己
Like you can express yourself be this

402
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,400
你知道，就像听话的人对某件事有联系一样
You know , like obedient persons being connectary as about something

403
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,210
一些事情，或者像和他一起散步并尝试成为更多的合作伙伴等等
Something , or like walk with him and try to maybe be more of a partner and so on

404
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,930
当然，大家始终与他同行
Of course , everybody always walks with him

405
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,810
因为这是最吸引人的内容
Because it's the most attractive content

406
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,662
比方说，嗯
Let's say , um

407
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:15,820
所以这是一回事
So this was one thing

408
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,950
其次，我们一直想为玩家提供
And second , we always wanted to give players

409
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,370
在任何特定时刻都有尽可能多的自由
As much freedom as possible at any given moment

410
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,830
就像我们总是问我们一些事情
Like we're always asking us stuff

411
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,200
好的
Okay

412
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,330
我们现在能给玩家更多的自由吗？
Can we give player more freedom in this moment that we are giving him right now

413
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,530
当然你不能总是这样做
And of course you cannot always do this

414
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:36,805
因为有时你有一个非常精确的信息需要吸引玩家的注意力
Because sometimes you have a very precise information that you need to focus player's attention on

415
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:40,790
嗯，为了让他不要让他们分心
Um , for him not to get for them to not get distracted

416
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,370
如果玩家途中分心
If the player gets distracted by the way

417
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,720
他指责比赛不给他机会
He blames the game for like not giving him

418
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,100
这些信息足够好，而不是像存在，哦耶
The information well enough instead of like being , oh yeah

419
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,310
也许应该，也许我应该更多
Should maybe , maybe i should have be more

420
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,770
你知道，以后要小心
You know , careful the back then

421
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,240
现在这样不行了
Now it doesn't work this way

422
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,890
一
Um

423
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,290
所以有时候是故意的
So sometimes on purpose

424
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,290
我们像某处所说的那样培养收藏家
We make collectors like said somewhere

425
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,400
或者，你知道，就像靠在某个东西上，让你的注意力集中在与你交谈的其他角色上
Or , you know , like lean on something to just focus you on other character talking to you

426
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,040
但即便如此，我们仍然想给你
But even then we want to like give you still the

427
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,609
呃，相机自由度，呃，运动
Uh , camera of the freedom of camera , uh , movement

428
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,280
但那里，呃，甚至像这里这样的场景
But there , uh , even the scenes like here

429
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,900
比如说，和你喜欢的这个助手一起去
For example , with this assistant that you just like went

430
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,480
例如，从他身边经过
Went past him , for example

431
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,599
从我们的角度来看这不是一个超级重要的场景
It's not a super important scene from our perspective

432
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,619
就像是一团绒毛
Like it's a fluff

433
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,109
所以基本上我们可以在这里为您提供更多的自由
So basically we can provide you more freedom here

434
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,730
这取决于你想不想和他说话
It's up to you want to talk with him

435
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,270
你想要旋转并站在他身后
you want to like rotate and stand behind him

436
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,930
然后他就会轮流转向你
And he rotates to you

437
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,470
他是否轮换并不重要
It doesn't really matter if he's rotated or not

438
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,700
因为后台启动那件事很重要
Because the background is started that thing important

439
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,040
如果这是一个主线故事的话
If though it would be a main story

440
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,680
告诉你，电脑是非常非常重要的东西
And pc was something really , really important to tell you

441
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,120
例如，我们可能不知道他会抓住你
We would probably i don't know he would catch you for example

442
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,600
或者他会说，来吧
Or he would be like , come on

443
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,400
让我们在这里停留一会儿
Let's stay here for a little moment

444
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,700
我需要告诉你更多的事情
I need to tell you something more

445
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,360
等等
And so on

446
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,440
所以我们知道他所关注的球员就像
So just the player we know that he's focused on like

447
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,877
我们在 daan 特定时刻呈现的内容
What we are presenting at daan given moment

448
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:54,240
所以我们经常谈论
So we are often talking about

449
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,530
关于噪声和信号关于我们需要始终理解的这个想法
about noise and signal about this idea that we need to always understand

450
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,810
最重要的信息想传达给玩家什么
What the most important information want to convey to the player

451
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,110
正确的
Right

452
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,660
是我们希望玩家体验的实际内容
Was the actual thing that we want the player to experience

453
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,160
去感受、去理解
To feel , to to understand

454
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,030
当这一幕真实发生后
After the scene actually happened

455
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,620
呃
Uh

456
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,460
我们有多种方式引导玩家放弃这种体验
And we have multiple ways to guide the player drop this experience

457
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,600
呃，就像你那套里的一样
Uh , like in your set

458
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,337
人们坐下，人们走开
People sitting down , people walking away

459
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:20,670
玩家处于封闭空间
Player being in a closed space

460
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,930
玩家输入av ，就像在这个例子中一样，对吧
Player entering av , like in this case , right

461
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,740
呃，这些其实都是我们整个游戏过程中可以用到的工具
Uh , all of those are actually the tools that we can use during the whole game

462
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,650
这以一种希望无缝的方式融合了旁白和游戏玩法
And that blend the narration and gameplay in a way that's hopefully seamless

463
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,210
我，我认为在大多数情况下都是这样
And i , i think in this case for most of the time

464
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,240
我们实际上成功了，呃
We actually succeeded in that , uh

465
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,570
而你享受
And you enjoy

466
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,090
而且，你知道，你，你，你在整个体验过程中都在玩
And , you know , and you , you , you play throughout the experience

467
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,020
但实际上从来没有，呃
But there's never actually , uh

468
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,390
在旁白部分和游戏部分之间切换
Cut between the narration part and the gameplay part

469
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:55,420
就像我们看到的，就像我们在猎魔人，呃，片段中看到的那样
Like we watched , like we saw in the , in the witcher , uh , fragment

470
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,980
两者之间有明显的区别，对吗？
There is a clear separation between one and the other , right

471
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,200
在这个游戏中，在这个非常特别的游戏中
And in this game , in this very particular game

472
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,140
没有
There is none

473
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,520
我们想要推动这种程度的自由
We wanted to push this amount of freedom

474
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,870
我们可以给玩家尽可能多的
We can give the player as much as possible

475
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,590
当它仍在交付时，重视一个想要讲述的非常特别的故事
While it's still deliving , valuvering a very particular story that want to tell

476
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,465
因为在一天结束时
Because at the very end of the day

477
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:15,890
我们是学习者，对吧
We are study tters , right

478
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,610
我们，我们想讲述这个故事
We , we want to deliver this story

479
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,390
我们想要创造的这种激动人心的东西
This emotional gut punching thing that we want to create

480
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,430
并想让玩家体验火爆
And want to player to experience hot

481
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:24,930
是的
Yeah

482
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,990
一，一
Um , um

483
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,320
是的
Yeah

484
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,640
是的
Yeah

485
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,180
是的
Yeah

486
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,600
我会
I will

487
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,200
所以是的
So yeah

488
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
我感觉里面有很多东西
I feel like there's so much in , in there

489
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,360
所以，听起来你们很像
And so it , it sounds like you guys

490
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,020
你是在谈论一个，呃
Are you're kind of talking about a , uh

491
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,080
一种控制方式
A way of controlling

492
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,930
一
Um

493
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,430
或者建议喜欢玩家关注
Or suggesting like player attention

494
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,950
或者就像在某些不那么重要的时刻
Or like in some moments where it's less critical

495
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,190
他们有更多的自由
They have more freedom

496
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,150
所以如果他们错过了也没关系
So if they miss it , it's fine

497
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,570
但在类似故事的关键时刻
But in like story critical moments

498
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,370
您可以掌控一切以确保人们不会错过它
You are able to like take control to make sure people don't miss it

499
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,590
而且，就像你说的，你知道
And , and also like you're saying , you know

500
00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,290
从游戏玩法到电影的无缝过渡
The seamlessness of moving from gameplay to cinematics

501
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,627
你知道，我，我想我很早就记得了
You know , i , i think i remember early on

502
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:05,140
呃，保罗，你和我就像在推特上聊天一样
Uh , paul , you and i were like chatting on twitter

503
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,420
还有一场关于电影艺术的对话
And there was a conversation about cinematics

504
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,340
我当时想，等等
And i was like , wait

505
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,960
这游戏有动画吗
Are there cinematics in this game

506
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,380
因为它，感觉不像传统的电影理念
Because it , it doesn't feel like the conventional like idea of cinematics

507
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,900
所以我想，我认为你们一定能实现这一点
And so i think , i think you guys definitely achieve that

508
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,240
因为我的大脑必须喜欢处理类似的事情，好吧
Because it my brain had to like process that of like , all right

509
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,880
就像这些算作电影，因为它是讲故事的
Like these count as cinematics because it's storytelling

510
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,230
但在第一人称视角下却是如此无缝
But it is so seamless in that first person perspective

511
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,510
你可以在办公室里跑来跑去
Where you can be running around the office

512
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,510
现在你在这辆车里
And now you're in this car

513
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,510
呃，你知道，飞行汽车avv，对吧
Uh , you know , the the flying car avv , right

514
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,730
是的
Yeah

515
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,150
AV，呃，啊，参加这个很棒的巡演
Av , uh , ah , getting this awesome tour

516
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,922
而且是如此天衣无缝
And it is so seamless

517
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:40,560
一
Um

518
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,340
我只是觉得这是一件非常令人印象深刻的事情
I just think that's a really impressive thing

519
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,370
我觉得
And i feel like the

520
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,860
汽车修理工是对我来说最突出的事情之一
the car mechanics is one of the things that stood out to me

521
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,860
作为，作为有时的例子，呃
As , as an example of sometimes when , uh

522
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,580
你就像接到某人的任务
You're like getting a mission from someone

523
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,040
你走，你坐在车里
You go and you sit in the car

524
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,380
然后你就不能走动了
And then you can't move around

525
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,680
所以你有点被迫，呃
So you're sort of forced to , uh

526
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,420
以某种方式聆听该玩家的声音
Listen to that player in a way

527
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,252
这仍然让人感觉身临其境且真实
That still feels immersive and true to the world

528
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,050
所以，是的
So , yeah

529
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,090
你们还用过其他一些技巧吗？
Where there's some other techniques you guys used to , uh

530
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,722
在需要时吸引玩家的注意力
Draw player attention when you needed to

531
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,600
嗯，有很多这样的
Well , there are like so many

532
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,920
我们甚至可以停下来，呃
And we could like even stop , uh

533
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,520
不知道下一个场景
I don't know at the next scene

534
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,960
我们可以谈谈这个
And we can talk about this

535
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,140
我的意思是，有些比较复杂，有些则比较简单
I mean , some of them are more complex , sometimes less

536
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,310
但是，嗯，呃，有人可能会在这一点上发表评论
But , um , uh , one may remark at this point

537
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,830
我，我认为这是游戏制作过程中的一个有趣的发现
Which i , i think was like an interesting discovery during the making of the game

538
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,560
就像一开始一样，这整个就像我喜欢太阳能fpp的想法
Like at the beginning , this whole like i like solar fpp idea

539
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,740
或者在整个游戏过程中
Or throughout the game

540
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,160
就像工作室里很多人并不买账一样
Like many people at the studio didn't really buy it

541
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,200
或者你没有真正明白或喜欢
Or didn't you they really get it or like

542
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,220
但你要如何讲述此时此刻
But how are you going to tell this moment or this moment

543
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,160
就像这怎么可能
Like how's it possible

544
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,220
当然你需要喜欢做特写
Of course you need to like do a close up

545
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,127
你知道，插话什么的
You know , cut in or something

546
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:42,930
一
Um

547
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,810
而且，呃，实际上我们非常关心，好吧
And , uh , actually we were pretty concerned with like , okay

548
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,880
我们给予玩家自由
We give players freedom

549
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,280
所以他们会喜欢在我们重要的场景中
So they will just like in the middle of our important scene

550
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,800
他们会转身走开
They will turn around and walk away

551
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
就像我的故事等等
And like what with my story and so on

552
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,760
而实际上
And actually

553
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,820
事实证明，对于 98% 的玩家来说
And it turns out that for ninety eight percent of players

554
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,540
人们只是想玩游戏
People just want to play the game

555
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,040
这很像一个简单的想法
It's a very like a simple maybe thought

556
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,360
但这对我们来说至关重要
But it's a crucial for us

557
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,060
因此，人们通常希望您能够为他们提供最具吸引力的内容
So people usually they want the most attractive content you can provide them with

558
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,800
如果他们有像超有吸引力的NPC
If they have like the super attractive npc

559
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,250
同样很酷的东西和移动可以令人印象深刻并且喜欢尝试
Same cool stuff and moving can immating and like trying to

560
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,870
你知道，与他们有联系等等
You know , relate to them and so on

561
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,410
就像他们为什么会选择看人行道一样
Like why would they choose looking at the sidewalk

562
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,400
或者就像在这个特定的时刻走开
Or like walking away at this given moment

563
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,720
就像一开始我们在想
And like at the beginning we were thinking

564
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,640
哦，我们需要确保所有员工的安全，需要所有这些围栏系统等等
Oh , we'll need to secure all the staff would like all those fence systems and so on

565
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,530
然后当你喜欢在youtube上观看《rust》时，人们就会准确地玩
And then when you like watch play rust on youtube , people play exactly

566
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,890
他们希望他们像我们希望他们那样打球
They want they like the way we want them to play

567
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,030
即使他们可以打破比赛
Even though they could break the game

568
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,350
就像在很多不同的场合走开一样
Just by like walking away at so many different occasions

569
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,297
一
Um

570
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:42,620
例如，也许实际上不在此处的产品中，或者为什么在此处
Maybe not in the product actually here or why at this , for example

571
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,180
这是游戏的开头
This is opening of of of the game

572
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,900
我们不想让玩家离开去参观整个城市
We didn't want the players to leave to like visit the whole city

573
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,190
所以在你的一系列类似的有限香料中
So here in your in a series of like limited spices

574
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,090
但是当你到达你的时候
But when you get to the u

575
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,510
主要主线剧情，你有这个，我不认识npc
Main main story , you have this , i don't know npc

576
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,620
你知道，你在某个地方遇见了巴拿马
You meet , you know , panam somewhere

577
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,480
就像在他们的谈话中
And like in the middle of their conversation

578
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,960
你可以转身走开，两个月后再回去
You could just like turn around and walk away and go back after two months

579
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,865
就像接听谈话一样
And just like pick up on the conversation

580
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:09,740
事实证明几乎没有人这样做过
Turns out almost no one does it ever

581
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,810
所以实际上我们可以允许自己提供更多的自由
So actually we could allow ourselves to like provide more freedom

582
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,810
明知道无论如何人们都不会接受
Knowing that people won't take it anyway

583
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,070
但就像感觉会存在一样
But like the feeling will be there

584
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,990
哦，我可以做到这一点
Oh , i could do this

585
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,090
这太酷了
This is so cool

586
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,292
但就像，但你不会对
But like , but you won't right

587
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:24,980
因为这是你知道的、迷人的幻想在跟你说话
Because here's the you know , attractive fantasy talking to you

588
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,850
我认为迈克尔之前所说的关于整个体验的无缝性很重要
I think it's important what you michael said before about the seamlessness of the whole experience

589
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,840
因为对我来说，就像电影中好的剪辑基本上是玩家看不见的一样
Because for me , just like a good edit in a movie is basically invisible to the player

590
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,880
我感觉到我们传递这些重要内容的方式
i feel the way that we deliver those important

591
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,530
不太重要的故事节拍也应该以同样的方式对玩家不可见
And less important story beats should be invisible to the player in the same way

592
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,210
他们甚至不应该明白
They should not even understand that

593
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,850
哦，这个有点多了
Oh , this is something a bit more

594
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,960
你知道，最好知道
You know , be better to know

595
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,740
内部保真度更高，对吧
Have more fidelity inside , right

596
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,720
而这部分其实不太重要
And this part is actually less important

597
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,980
但是，对于玩家来说，最终的体验应该还是非常相似的
But the , the the experience should still be very much the same for the player in the end

598
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,440
我再次觉得网络PK做得很好
And i feel again that it it's something that cyber pk does pretty well

599
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,300
所以我不知道你现在是否想谈论这个
So i know not if you want to talk about this right now

600
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,760
但是，呃，我们基本上把整个叙述分成了非常具体的部分
But , uh , we basically divided the whole narration into very specific parts

601
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,700
我们决定的地方
Where we decide

602
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:09,920
好的
Okay

603
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,960
这是祈祷需要有很大自由的部分
This is the part where the prayer needs to have a lot of freedom

604
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,780
这实际上是我们最想提供的自由的部分
And this is the part where actually the freedom that that we want to deliver the most

605
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,080
这是最有力的叙述，对吧
That the most punchy amount of narration possible , right

606
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,350
所以我们称它们为眼泪
So we call them tears

607
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,730
所以我们从一到五
So we have teers through one to five

608
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,810
第一个是完全游戏
And the first one is fully game play

609
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,930
第五部基本都是过场动画
The fifth is basically fully cutscene

610
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,180
现在我们就在中间
And right now we are straight in the middle

611
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,620
所以这是第三层，玩家实际上坐下来
So this is the third tier where players actually sitting down

612
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,460
而且它对相机的控制非常有限
And it has very limited control of the camera

613
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,420
但这使我们能够提供特定的内容
But this allows us to deliver specific content

614
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,420
这使得我们可以拥有内部没有摄像头的相机，对吧
This allows us to have camera without cameras inside , right

615
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,470
我们，我们，我们也许有相同的工具
We , we do , we have the same tools maybe

616
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,620
但我们仍然没有这样的削减
But still we don't have the cut that would

617
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,760
这在电影中是找不到的
That would not about be found in a movie

618
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,390
实际上你可以在这里看到，嗯
And actually you can see here , um

619
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,290
基本上这对杰基来说是一个中景，对吧
Basically what's this a medium shot towards to jackie , right

620
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,790
如果他真的对我们有意
And if he actually means towards us

621
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,990
我们突然把衣服脱光了
We have clothes up suddenly

622
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,710
如果他站起来并真的走开
If he gets up and actually walk away

623
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,710
我们还有更多东西
We have something more

624
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,320
这样我们就可以充分利用现有的内容
So we can play a lot with the content that we have

625
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,960
即使玩家可能根本不明白发生了什么
Even though the player might not even understand what's happened

626
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,020
因为他想坐下来
Because he wanted to sit down

627
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,520
因为游戏，你知道，收获
Because the game , you know , the gain

628
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,560
游戏提供了坐下的选项，这是这次转换对话中最吸引人的部分，对吗？
The game presented the options to sit down as the most attractive part of this convert conversation , right

629
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,330
因为他邀请我们参与对话
Because he invites us towards the conversation

630
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,240
有人玩家，玩家认为，好吧
And somebody player , player thinks , okay

631
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,500
是的
Yeah

632
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:25,680
是的
Yeah

633
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:25,920
当然
Sure

634
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,500
绝对地
Absolutely

635
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,390
我会加入你
I will join you

636
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,330
呃，坐下
Uh , and sit down

637
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,850
我们会一起喝一杯
And we'll have a drink together

638
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,310
尽管这正是我们希望他们做的
Even though this is exactly what we wanted them to

639
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,970
去感受你
To , to feel you

640
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,730
玩这款游戏时真正让我印象深刻的一件事是，你知道，我自己也是一名电影制片人
One thing that really struck me playing the game was , you know , as a filmmaker myself

641
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,390
我不再只是世界上的一名演员
I was getting to be not just an actor in the world

642
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,650
但作为一名电影摄影师
But a cinematographer

643
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,730
你知道，我，我被赋予了创建自己的框架的自由
you know , i , i was given the freedom to create my own frames

644
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,820
并选择我想要的框架在任何特定时刻的样子
And to choose what i wanted my frame to be in any given moment

645
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,010
这是一次非常有趣的经历，是的
And it was a really interesting experience where , yeah

646
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,970
有时我会使用该按钮稍微放大一点，使其更近一些
Sometimes i would use that button to kind of zoom in a bit to just make it a little bit more close up

647
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,510
是的
Yeah

648
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,250
或者，或者，或者，或者有时候我会的，你知道的
Or , or , or , or sometimes i would , you know

649
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,040
我希望你能移动，这样，你知道，这个角色
I would you move so that , you know , the character

650
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,320
我说话的对象就在画面的一角
I was talking to was like just on the corner of the frame

651
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,940
但你知道，这主要是一个
But it was mostly , you know , a

652
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,690
他们身后的风景
A landscape behind them

653
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,630
这真是一次全新的体验
And that was just a really new experience

654
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,100
就像我几乎被邀请去的地方
Where like i was invited almost to

655
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,180
为了帮助以大多数游戏的方式拍摄这部电影
To help shoot this movie in a way that most games

656
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,202
你知道，你们完全可以控制每一帧的样子
You know , you guys are completely in control of , of what each frame looks like

657
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,050
呃，我是说
Uh , i mean

658
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,960
是的
Yeah

659
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,970
嗯，呃
Um , uh

660
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,170
是的
Yeah

661
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:21,470
当然
Sure

662
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:21,850
呃
Uh

663
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,610
并且，呃，例如，在那些没有鹿的场景中
And , uh , for example , in those like deer free scenes

664
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,680
我们现在在哪里
Where were where we are u right now

665
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,360
就像相机的旋转一样
It's just like the rotation of the camera

666
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,960
但有很多对一和二，两个场景
But there are like many to one and two , two scenes

667
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,080
您可以在场景中自由移动
Where you can just move freely around the scene

668
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,560
尽管你几乎可以在每个场景中飞来飞去
And even though you can move fly around for almost each scene

669
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,260
我们试图创造一种我们称之为“最佳点”的东西
We tried to create something that we call the sweet spot

670
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,180
就像这样将人物、元素和生活在画面中上演
Which is like this kind of like staging of characters and elements and life in the frame

671
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,590
那种喜欢潜意识里让你站在一个特定的点上
That kind of like subconsciously makes you stand in a specific point

672
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,580
就像你那样做
And like you kind of just do it

673
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,940
对我们来说，这正是重点
And for us , this is the exact point

674
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,340
我们希望你站在哪里
Where we want want you to stand

675
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,060
因为例如这里的背景
Because for example here the background

676
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,080
它的作用就像更好的构图
It works for like a better composition

677
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,690
或者喜欢它以某种方式增加了民主党呃
Or like it somehow adds to the dem uh

678
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,170
或者像增强故事联系一样。等等
Or like enhances the story tying . and so on

679
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,950
通常它就像将角色放置在哪里一样简单
And usually it's as simple as just like placing the character like where

680
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,770
npc的正面在哪里
Where is the front of the npc

681
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,090
通常人们会站在npc的正前方
Usually people will stand right in front of the npc

682
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,110
所以在这里我们知道
So here we know

683
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,890
但我们也可以尝试限制空间
But we can also try to limit the space

684
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,950
身体上有一些资产，比如夏天等等
Physically with some like assets , summer and so on

685
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,910
所以就像，是的，这是npc的正面
So like , yeah , here's the front of npc

686
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,930
但我们被封锁在这里
But we are blocked here

687
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,990
所以实际上你会站到左边一点
So actually you will stand a little bit to the left

688
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,710
呵呵，然后就会有不喜欢的酷
Oh , and then there will be dislike cool

689
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,977
你知道，画面的深度什么的
You know , depth in the frame or something

690
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:31,140
你可以，嗯，使用，呃
You can , um , use , uh

691
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,760
也喜欢小细节
Also like small details

692
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,960
例如，在地面上
For example , on the ground

693
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,280
有时我知道你有电缆
Sometimes i know you have cables

694
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,980
他们有点像这样
And they kind of make like this

695
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,000
我在某种程度上不了解这个地区
I don't know this area in a way

696
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,500
潜意识里你就站在这个区域内
And subconsciously you stand inside this area

697
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,200
如果有闪电
If there's a lightning

698
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,600
在黑暗的地方你不会明白。等等
You don't understand in the dark places . and so on

699
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,170
所以你可以结合很多不同的元素来以某种方式让玩家
So you can combine a lot of those different elements to somehow make the player

700
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,510
你想让他在哪里
Where you want him to be

701
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,050
我们为此拥有的最后一个工具就像
And the last tool we have for this it's like

702
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,550
假设游戏的金属级别是，呃
Let's say on the metal level of the game is , uh

703
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,670
只是设计交互如何呈现给玩家以及会发生什么
Just the design of how the interactions appear to the player and what happens

704
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,240
所以你可以，例如
So you could , for example

705
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,200
尝试测试一下你什么时候看到对话选项出现
Try to test when do you see the dialogue choices appearing

706
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,390
你离一个角色有多远
How far you are away from a character

707
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,440
因此您无法单击以下选项
So you cannot click the choices from

708
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,920
你知道，有很多摊位
You know , a lot of the stands

709
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,530
因为那时就像这样的电脑
Because then like then pcs like this

710
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,110
有一个，你知道，一个巨大的镜头
There's a , you know , a huge shot

711
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,270
我们不想告诉你一个故事内容
And we don't want to tell you a story content

712
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,590
那里的npc超级超级小
Where like the npc is super , super tiny

713
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,420
所以我们限制了，嗯
So we limited like the the , um

714
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,650
对话选择的范围如何迫使你更加接近
The range of how of where the dialogue choices appear to force you in a way to be closer

715
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,930
但话又说回来，正如pao所说
But again , as pao said

716
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,250
这一切都应该是看不见的
It all should feel invisible

717
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,370
它应该感觉自然并且突出
It should just feel natural and project o

718
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,210
现在我可以说话了
And now i can talk

719
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,890
而且感觉应该是公正的，你知道的
And it should feel just , you know

720
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,010
在某种程度上是正确的
Correct in a way

721
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,110
或者举个例子，明白了，呃
Or for example , understand , uh

722
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,030
每当你选择对话选项时
Whenever you pick a dialogue choice

723
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,510
不看npc
Not looking at the npc

724
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,890
我们会自动将你轮换到npc
We will automatically rotate you to the npc

725
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,390
只是为了确保你不只是像流动员工并在这里的某个地方做出选择
Just to make sure that you are not just like loating staff and taking choices somewhere here

726
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,130
就像忘记这一切一样
And like forgetting about all of this

727
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,830
但实际上在选择的时候
But actually when picking choice

728
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,150
它提醒你，你知道，这是关于故事的
It reminds you , you know , to that it's about story

729
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:03,050
但同样，大多数时候人们在选择选择时已经在看npc了
But again , most of the time people pick choices while already looking at npc

730
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:06,630
所以他们并没有真正意识到这个，嗯，效果是一样的
So they don't really perceive this , um , effect that same

731
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,350
这是我们和约翰，呃，还有杰基斯
And here the uswith john , uh , with jackie si

732
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,890
就像想要完成一样
Just like want to finish

733
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,610
我喜欢这个场景，就像舞台的运作方式一样
I like the scene in terms of like how staging works

734
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,260
你走近他，作为欢迎的特写镜头
You approach him as a close up for welcome

735
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,420
然后是中景
Then it's a medium shot

736
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,380
然后你说的话与你相冲突
Then you are saying something that conflicts you

737
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,687
于是他走开了
So he walks away

738
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:22,490
其他人，请进来
Other guys , guys come in

739
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,030
他们喜欢围绕着你
They like kind of surround you

740
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,470
其中一个人靠得更近了
One of them leans closers

741
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,450
所以这就像是，你知道
So it's like , you know

742
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,710
给你更大的压力然后杰基节省为零
More pressure on your then jackie saves zero

743
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,150
所以有点像再次
So it kind of like again

744
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,530
舞台表演有点倒退
The staging goes a little bit back

745
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,210
最后
And in the end

746
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,370
他再次和你一起在最后为这就像法国前线的时刻换上衣服
He joins you again for a clothes up for this like front to french moment at the very end

747
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,680
所以我们拍摄了一系列的照片
So we had the whole array of shots

748
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,890
虽然实际上几乎没有在镜头前移动
While actually not moving at the camera almost at all

749
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,862
就像以某种方式围绕场景旋转一样
Just like rotating it , you know , around the scene in a way

750
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:46,620
对不起
Sorry

751
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,580
不
No

752
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:54,050
我真的很喜欢有这样一种疯狂的内容，我们可以在什么时候谈论
I seriously like there is such an insane breath of content that we can talk about when

753
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,730
每当我们真正看这个游戏时
Whenever we actually look at this game

754
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,070
正确的
Right

755
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,930
这我，我喜欢，我喜欢这个场景
This i , i like , i love this scene

756
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,410
呃，什么，什么急于营救杰基
Uh , what , what eager set about jackie rescue

757
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,530
并猜测此时此刻
And guess in this moment

758
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,270
这一刻我爱他们
I love them this moment

759
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,940
因为当他这样做的时候，声音就会传到你的耳中
Because when he does that , the , the sound comes back to you

760
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,820
突然间，基地实际上受到了更大的打击
Suddenly the , the base actually hits even harder

761
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,180
正确的
Right

762
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,350
而这一切的发生只是因为我们是电影设计师
And this all happens only because we are cinematic designers

763
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,380
呃，一直在和其他团队合作
Uh , are constantly working with other teams

764
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,760
因此，例如，在这种情况下
So , for example , in this case

765
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,740
音频和音乐，呃
The audio and music , uh

766
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,475
你知道，实际上是设计师和创作者
You know , designers and composes actually

767
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:24,400
我们正在与我们合作，以交付
We're working with us to , to , to deliver

768
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,710
这一刻对玩家来说最好的版本，对吧
The best possible version of this moment to , to , to the player , right

769
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,760
因为这不会在真空中发生
Because this does not happen in a vacuum

770
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,202
就像这一切一样
Like all of this

771
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:36,950
另外，所有的内容基本上都存在于整个游戏中
In other , all the contents basically exist within the whole game

772
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,110
整个游戏是由很多人创造的
And the whole game is created by a lot of people

773
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,790
呃
Uh

774
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,760
和
And

775
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,830
一方面
And on one hand

776
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:47,430
你可以说电影设计师实际上正在创造我们可以在这些场景中使用的两个场景
You can say cinematic designers are actually creating that the two sets that we can use in those scenes

777
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,470
但另一方面
But on the other hand

778
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,620
我们都与其他人一起工作
We all work with other people

779
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,640
我们交付，你知道，一些非常非常有趣的东西
And we delivery , you know , some something very , very fun

780
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,480
呃呃，最后
Uh , uh , at the end of it

781
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,120
好的
All , right

782
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,700
进入半年蒙太奇
Onto the half year montage

783
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,820
之后我认为我们进入了最具争议的时刻之一
After which i think we go to at one of the most controversial moments

784
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,940
嗯，在游戏中
Um , in the game

785
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,020
比如说，呃，互联网上有很多人担心它应该可以玩
Let's say , uh , a lot of concerns on the internet that it should have been playable

786
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,800
等等
And so on

787
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,950
我们总是这样思考序列
And we always thought about the sequence as such

788
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,090
我们一直想加快故事的进度
And we always wanted to speed up the story

789
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,820
让我们来谈谈真正重要的是什么
Let's say a little bit to what's really crucial for it

790
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,560
例如，从我的角度来看
And for example , from my perspective

791
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,760
如果我们真的和杰基一起度过这六个月的话，就像结构上的那样
If we really spend those six months here with jackie , like from the structure

792
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,480
屏幕位置结构观点
Screen place structure point of view

793
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,380
假设你就像第一幕一样
Let's say you are in like the first act

794
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,500
事实上甚至在之前，你知道，转折点等等
And actually before even like , you know , the turning point and so on

795
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,430
所以这就像拉伸超长时间一样
So it would be just like stretching it for super long

796
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,950
实际行动从这里开始
And here the actual action starts

797
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,870
它开始一次就像在最高的末尾
And it starts once like at the end of the highest

798
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,850
你知道，当你拿到筹码时，约翰尼·银的手就在你的脑海里
You know , when you get the chip with johny silver hand in your head

799
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,070
就像在这部分扩展游戏一样
So like expanding the game on this part

800
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,320
这对于我们稍后要告诉你的事情来说并不起作用
It doesn't really work for what we want to tell you later

801
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,960
这是关于与约翰尼·尤的个人关系的故事
And it's the story about this personal relationship with johnny yoo

802
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,720
那些其他角色等等
Those other characters and so on

803
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,660
就像和杰基一起在城市里做演出一样
And just like doing gigs with jackie around the city

804
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,510
当然很酷
Sure it's cool

805
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,050
但这非常像开放世界的公式
But it's a very like open world formula

806
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,940
没有特定的角色目标或特定的冲突
Without particular like goal for the character or particular conflict

807
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,720
我就像这个想知道赚钱的人
I'm just like this guy trying to know to earn some money

808
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,960
但一旦我们开始死亡，就不再真正关注它
But there's no real tention to it once we start dying

809
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,920
还有过去的网络恐怖分子
And the cyber terrorists from the past

810
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,310
如你所知，就像在你的脑海里一样
As you know , like in your head

811
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,930
但这就是，你知道，紧张局势产生的地方
But this is where the , you know , the tension arises

812
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,190
我想，对吧
I think , right

813
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,940
一
Um

814
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,070
然而对我来说，这就是，这就是旧世界
Yet to me , this is , this is the old world

815
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,100
你知道，在一个经典的英雄之旅三幕结构中
You know , in a , in a classic hero's journey three act structure

816
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,340
这只是确定旧世界是什么
This is just establishing what the old world is

817
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,500
当你离开旧世界时，故事才真正开始
And the story really gets going when you leave the old worlds

818
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,940
这就是约翰尼银手
And that's the johny silver hand

819
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,520
你知道，遗迹，对吧
You know , relic , right

820
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,220
所以，在这一切之前你确实可以和杰基一起执行一些任务并建立这种关系
So , and you do get to play some missions with jackie before all that and build up that relationship

821
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,260
还有，所以，是的
And , and so , yeah

822
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,050
所以，我们已经完成了公司简介，呃
So , so we've finished the kind of the corpo intro , uh

823
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,550
现在我们要开始抢劫了，呃
And now we are gonna jump to the heist , uh

824
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,530
所以这有点像这种序言介绍的结尾，呃
So this is sort of like at the end of this kind of prologue intro , uh

825
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,440
这一切都是为了这次抢劫任务
It's all building up to this heist mission

826
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,720
超级有趣
Which was super fun

827
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,520
我爱抢劫
I love heists

828
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,230
所以我真的很喜欢玩抢劫，呃
And so i really enjoyed getting to play through a heist , uh

829
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,950
还有所有这些 eb 和流向它
And there's all these ebs and flows to it

830
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,140
而且，我们会看看，嗯
And , and we'll take a look at that , um

831
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,020
但有些事情你们我们是
But kind of some one of the things you guys we're

832
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,220
我们只是说我认为真正有趣的是
We're just saying that i think is really interesting is

833
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,100
你知道你本质上是如何使用字符阻塞的，对吧
You know how you're using essentially character blocking , right

834
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,800
就像场景中演员的移动来创造不同的镜头
Like the movement of the actors in a scene to create different camera

835
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,020
你知道，你知道，特写镜头还是中景镜头
You know , you know , a closeup or a medium shot

836
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,020
那么那些效果
So those effects

837
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,770
但也是剧院的方式
But also the way in theater

838
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,890
当你去看电影或戏剧时，你会使用阻塞
You use blocking where , you know , you go to see a movie or a , a play

839
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:26,270
以及角色彼此远离或靠近时的动作
And the movement of the characters when they walk away from each other or towards each other

840
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,790
背对着观众
Face the audience face away

841
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,600
就像所有的一切都带有情感
Like all of that has an emotional

842
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,270
呃，意义重大
Uh , significance to it

843
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:39,180
所以这是一种像戏剧表演阻塞的奇怪混合体
And so it's this kind of weird hybrid of like theatrical play blocking

844
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,460
但仍然需要与相机进行交互
But with a camera that still has to be interacted with

845
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,400
是的
And yeah

846
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,060
我只是好奇，就像那是什么
I'm just curious , like what was that

847
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,280
怎么样，你是怎么想到这个的？
How was , how was it getting your minds around that

848
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:54,920
就像发现使用角色移动来引导玩家的技术一样
And like discovering those techniques of using character movement to guide a player

849
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,310
这就是情感体验
That's emotional experience at

850
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,370
在某种程度上
At some level

851
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,020
我认为这和经典电影制作是一样的
I think it's the same as in classic film making

852
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,640
这么说吧。所以基本上，就像，如果你减少它
Let's say . so basically , like , if you reduce it

853
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,870
很多都在指导，呃
A lot is guiding , uh

854
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,330
观众的目光扫视屏幕，呃
Viewers eye around the screen , uh

855
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,429
同时向他提供不同的信息
While providing him with different information

856
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,760
并给出了类似的时间跨度，呃，呃
And given like span of time , uh , uh

857
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,489
所以基本上是随着时间的推移构建信息流
So basically a structuring the flow of information through time

858
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,690
呃，就像用冰所感知的那样
Uh , by like perceived with ice moustly

859
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,830
当然，就像，呃
Of course , like , uh

860
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,896
外面也有
Out there as well

861
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:24,900
一
Um

862
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,659
而且，嗯，这样
And , um , in this way

863
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,300
在某种程度上有点相似
It's kind of similar in a way

864
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,159
所以基本上我们从不希望角色喜欢
So like basically we never , you know , want characters to like

865
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,199
我们不希望屏幕上同时出现太多噪音
We don't want to have too much noise on the screen at the same time

866
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,880
例如
So for example

867
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,989
如果有重要的NPC跟你说话
If you have important npc talking to you

868
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,060
例如，我们会尝试以某种方式
We will try to somehow , for example

869
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,639
降低此时背景传来的噪音，嗯
Reduce the noise coming from the background at this moment , um

870
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,860
只是为了让某人能够，呃，能够专注于，呃，这件事
Just so that someone can , uh , can focus , uh , on this

871
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,760
所有这一切都像测试一样降临到我们身上
And all of this came to us like troud the tests

872
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,980
我想当他们只是在演戏的时候
I think when they were just like playing the scene

873
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,600
我当时，我真的无法集中注意力，好吧
And i was , i cannot focus really like , okay

874
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,320
所以让我们停下来
So let's stop

875
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,960
让我们想想哪里出了问题，背景中的鼻子太多了
Let's think what's wrong there's just too much nose in the background

876
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,320
而我的目光却不断地远离
And my eye constantly keeps getting away from

877
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,870
你知道，就像那里正在发生的事情的面孔
You know , like the face to something that's happening there

878
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,910
所以也许我们可以关闭交通
So maybe let's turn off the traffic

879
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,710
也许我们可以改变光链接的比例
Maybe let's change the ratio of light link

880
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,750
也许让我们稍微旋转一下这个场景
Maybe let's rotate this scene a little bit

881
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,830
就像旋转那些椅子一样。等等
And like rotate those chairs . and so on

882
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,110
所以就像是玛丽一样
So that like it's mari

883
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,300
现在被抑制了，等等
And now subdued and , and so on

884
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,350
所以基本上就是不断地判断，比如你是否分心了
So basically just constantly judging , like are you distracted

885
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,450
或者你正在感知你应该感知的东西
Or are you perceiving what you should be perceiving

886
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,470
当然，就像我们是自己最糟糕的评判者一样
And of course , like we are our own worst judges

887
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,770
我想，也喜欢看别人打球
I think , but also like watching other people play

888
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,530
从工作室周围获取反馈，嗯
Getting feedback from around the studio , um

889
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,650
等等，例如
And so on here , for example

890
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,850
有这样的分期案例
Have this case of staging

891
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,330
确切地
Exactly

892
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,390
所以我们有杰基，他就像一只手
So we have jackie , he's like on one hand

893
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,870
面向你
Facing towards you

894
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,610
而且，嗯，就像九十度一样，以，呃
And , um , like with ninety degrees , staging with the , uh

895
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,790
接待处就像是，你还能站在哪里？
Reception is like , where else could you stand

896
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,370
可能
Possibly

897
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,700
非常确定。你有行动自由
So sure . you have freedom of movement

898
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,760
而且你还可以在这里与一只发光的大手进行互动
And also you have interaction right here with a huge glowing hand

899
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,800
这样你就可以站在杰基后面
So you could stand behind the jackie

900
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,080
但这样的内容吸引力会降低
But like this would be the less attractive content

901
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,440
所以人们想看到面孔
So people want to see faces

902
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,230
他们想看到情感。等等
They want to see emotions . and so on

903
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,200
几乎所有人都站在这里
And almost everyone stands here

904
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,750
然后我们可以强迫你
And then we can force you

905
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,570
就像以某种方式强迫你
Like in a way force you

906
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,990
你，你不会知道的
You , you won't know it

907
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,760
但我们会强迫你，例如
But we will force you just by , for example

908
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,020
将这种推动任务进展的互动放在一个非常特别的聚光灯下
Putting this interaction that progresses the quest in a very particular spotlight here

909
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,960
只有在这里你才能最终压缩手
And only here you compress the hand in the end

910
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,890
你必须在此时结束
You have to end up at this point

911
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,150
你知道，呃
You know , uh

912
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,740
我的意思是，我们生来就具有同理心，对吗？
I mean , we are hard wired towards empathy , right

913
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,040
我们希望人与人之间建立联系
We want the connection between people

914
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,047
我们想要他们之间的互动
We want the interaction between them

915
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:31,170
所以我们的很多工作都是关于角色，关于那些微小的互动和反应
So a lot of our work is about characters , is about those tiny interactions , reactions

916
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,060
并且，以及人与人之间对话中涉及的一切
And , and everything that goes into conversation between people

917
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,460
我觉得我们从 reer 那里获得了大量的经验
And i feel that we have insane amount of experience from reer

918
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,120
因此，接近这个项目变得容易一些
So approaching this project was a tiny bit easier because of that

919
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,840
因为我们至少知道那部分经历
Because we knew at least that part of the experience

920
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,480
尽管一切都承认它实际上是完全不同的，对吧
Even though everything accept that it was actually completely different , right

921
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,800
而且非常复杂
And it was extremely complicated

922
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,350
呃
Uh

923
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,150
所以我觉得这很有趣
So i think it's interesting

924
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:01,880
因为我记得人们经常说我们转向第一人称
Because people of i remember people often often said that we move to first person

925
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,740
因为它更容易。因为我们看不到玩家角色
Because it's easier . because we don't see player character

926
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,035
只是那件事
Just the thing

927
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:09,160
就像你是否会看到复杂性一样
Like if if you would see the amount of complexity

928
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,300
第一人称、交互性和实时性
That first person and interactivity and real time

929
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,060
因为，你知道，你知道，你甚至没有这种奇怪的停顿
Because , you know , you know , you don't even even even have this kind of weird pause

930
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,540
当你选择“不在这里”这样的选择时，对吗？
When you pick choices like not really here , right

931
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,930
就像你周围的世界仍然在做事情一样，呃
Like the the world around you does stuff still , uh

932
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,290
如果你看到我们在《巫师》中的图表
If you would see the graphs that we had in witcher

933
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,330
以及我们在赛博朋克中看到的图表
And the graphs that we have in cyber punk there

934
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,150
不会大十倍吧
No ten times bigger , right

935
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,600
这太疯狂了
And it's it's insane

936
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,280
如果你想想有多少工作
If you think about how much work

937
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,980
你真的需要做吗
Do you need to actually to , to do

938
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,200
为了，为了让这一幕变得简单
To , to make this one simple scene

939
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,810
以让玩家满意的方式工作
Work in a way that satisfying towards the player

940
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,150
是的
Yeah

941
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,990
有些东西是看不见的
And some of the stuff is tinvisible

942
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,050
例如，这里的这个例子，这是一个超级简单的事情
For example , this case right here , it's a super simple thing

943
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,560
你和杰基一起去
You go with jackie

944
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,760
还有一个选项可以进入餐厅
And there's like an option to go into the restaurant

945
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,840
也许和外面的一些人谈谈
And maybe talk with some and pis out there

946
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
但就是这样，所以杰基
But there's so , so jackie

947
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,080
你有最高的权利这样做
And you have the highest to do so right

948
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,020
突然间有一个超级简单的事情
Suddenly there's like the super simple bit

949
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
我们需要思考，好吧
And we need to think , okay

950
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,090
如果玩家决定留在餐厅怎么办
So what if the player decides to stay in the restaurant

951
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:58,910
杰基做什么的
What does jackie do

952
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,850
如果玩家决定去电梯怎么办
What if the player decides to go to delevator

953
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,200
立即无视jackie等
Immediately and ignores jackie and so on

954
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,650
好的
Okay

955
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,030
因此，如果玩家站起来与接待处交谈
So if the player stands and talks with the reception is

956
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,150
所以杰基走开或者在餐厅旁边等候
So jackie walk away or like waied by the restaurant

957
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,600
好的
Okay

958
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,410
更简单
It's simpler

959
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,130
所以让他在餐厅等着我们就尝试了一下
So let's leave him waiting by the restaurant and we tried it

960
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,270
玩家走进餐厅，杰基拿着手提箱站在那里
And player goes into restaurant and jackie is just standing there with the suitcase

961
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,000
这让他在某种程度上看起来很傻
And it makes him look silly in a way

962
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,380
就像他有他的呃
Like he has his uh

963
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,180
他没有自己的生活
He doesn't have life on his own

964
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,660
他只是在那里等待玩家等等
He's just like there just for to wait for the player and so on

965
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,820
我们总是希望角色可信
And we always want the characters to be believable

966
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,160
所以在这种情况下杰克就像
So in this case jack is like

967
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,260
我不会等你
I'm not gonna wait for you

968
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,620
我就上楼去，你知道的
I'll just go upstairs and you know

969
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,740
就像当你需要的时候来加入我
Like come join me when you when you have to

970
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:38,067
然后他就走了，但是一个球员在最后一刻跳进了电梯
And then he goes , but what a player jumps into delevator at the very last moment

971
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:41,370
因为游戏已经让玩家玷污了餐厅
Because the game already things the player stain the restaurant

972
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:45,000
所以你需要保护所有这些情况
So you need to like secure all those situations

973
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,840
而从玩家的角度来看
And from the player perspective

974
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,190
每个变体都必须可信
Each of those variants needs to be believable

975
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,220
节奏很好
Well paced

976
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,180
表演得好，需要有道理。等等
Well acted , needs to make sense . and so on

977
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,500
还有一千个时刻
And there's a thousand moments

978
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,160
从玩家的角度来看
Which like from the player perspective

979
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,390
噢，在这个空间里感觉很对劲
Oh , it just felt right in this space

980
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:05,230
但就像你决定与南方精神病患者交谈五分钟一样
But like if you would decide to talk with the southern psy for five minutes

981
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,490
再多五秒钟，就会发生其他事情
Five seconds longer , something else would happen

982
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,270
这对你来说也是很自然的事
And that was also good natural for you

983
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,770
但你实际上从未看到分支
But you never see the branching actually

984
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,100
所以是的，那些走进餐厅的人
So yeah , people who go into the restaurant

985
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,720
杰基就上楼去了
Jackie just goes upstairs there

986
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,900
立即走向电梯的人
People who go immediately to the elevator

987
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,040
杰基和他们一起去，没有说什么
Jackie goes with them and doesn't say some things

988
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,135
因为这就像，你知道，不同的流程穿过，嗯，穿过场景
Because this is like , you know , different flow through the , um , through the scene

989
00:39:25,135 --> 00:39:28,710
我认为这很重要。急切地说了什么，呃
I think it's in , in , in it's important . what eager said , uh

990
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,960
我之前考虑过迭代的数量
i think before about the amount of iterations that

991
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,732
我们必须在非常基本的系统级别上做
We had to do on the very basic system level

992
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:37,870
例如
So for example

993
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,860
您渴望设置的距离，以进行交互，对吧
The what you eager set about the distance to , to , for interactions , right

994
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,610
例如
So for example

995
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:48,700
有时，交互实际上与其他地方的人相距很远，例如
Sometimes the interaction is actually pretty far away from the person in other places is actually very closed by for example

996
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,210
我记得有一天晚上，我们花了几个小时只迭代
I remember one evening when , when we spent hours iterating only on

997
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,810
到农作物需要多远的距离
How much distance do we need to have to crops

998
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,260
所以，你知道，做一些事情，例如，在桌子上，呃
So , you know , to do things , for example , on the table , uh

999
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,725
您需要以什么角度与他们进行互动
And what exact angle do you need to have to make the interactions with them

1000
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:07,980
恰到好处，你知道，感觉很好，对吧
Just right , you know , feel properly , right

1001
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,230
喜欢，喜欢，喜欢应该有的感觉
Like , like , like it should feel

1002
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:09,790
是的
Yeah

1003
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,530
因为如果玩家从极端距离和极端角度点击它
Because if player clicks it from the extreme distance and extreme angles

1004
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,970
你就像这片森林一样非常奇怪的混合
And you have like this woods really weird blending

1005
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,870
突然感觉它不再是一个身体了
And suddenly it doesn't feel like it's a body anymore

1006
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,010
我们之前讨论过的事情
The thing that we talked about before

1007
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:26,310
对我们来说创造你始终在身体内的东西是多么重要啊
How important it was for us to create this thing that you are inside the body at all times , uh

1008
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,810
突然感觉很机械化
And suddenly it feels very mechanning

1009
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,250
所以是的
So yeah

1010
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,650
我们还需要调整很多不同的
We need to like also adjust a lot of different

1011
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:34,080
Like 参数，表示事物在什么情况下如何被触发
Like parameters of how like things get triggered when

1012
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,830
所以，呃，一旦你看到某样东西，很多事情就会被触发
So , uh , a lot of things get trigger once you look at something

1013
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,970
或者当你进入某个空间或者某个触发器时
Or when you enter a certain space or a certain trigger

1014
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,610
再说一遍，这是关于思考的
So again , it's about thinking like

1015
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:42,900
好的
Okay

1016
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,340
如果玩家正好处于这个位置
If the player will be in this exact spot

1017
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,500
还有什么在争夺他的注意力
What else is fighting for his attention

1018
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:47,900
好的
Okay

1019
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,420
不多
Not much

1020
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,700
所以也许我们应该从 npc 触发这条线
So maybe we should trigger this line from npc

1021
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,200
嘿
Hey

1022
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,780
任何
Whatever

1023
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,330
此刻来到这里
Come here at this moment

1024
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,450
如果还是有太多来自不同方面的刺激
If there's still like too much stimuli coming from different sides

1025
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,410
也许你应该稍后触发这个时间
Maybe you should trigger this time a little bit later

1026
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,110
当你深入房间时
When you are deeper in the room

1027
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,357
周围的噪音又减少了，嗯
And there's like again , less noise around , um

1028
00:41:04,357 --> 00:41:05,600
呃，这里，嗯
Uh , here , um

1029
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,800
我我我愿意
I , i , i would like to

1030
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,980
也许是因为至少要谈论一下同时进行的游戏
Maybe because also to talk at least a little bit about the game that's being played at the same time

1031
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,440
而且不仅仅是将军
And not just generals

1032
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,130
两者，嗯，与身体不同
Both , um , distinct with body

1033
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,320
嗯，这对我们来说也是一个大话题
Um , it was also a big topic for us

1034
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,600
所以我设置了关于 fdp 方法的事情
So this thing i set about fdp approach

1035
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,620
但我们所说的身体存在对我们来说也非常重要
But also the thing we called body presence in general was super important for us

1036
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,480
不仅仅是从讲故事的角度来看,嗯
Not only from storytelling point of view , um

1037
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,880
但它也对这种身处世界的感觉产生了很大的束缚
But also it tighed a lot to this kind of feeling of being inside the world

1038
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,020
所以你可以在很多很多不同的场合看到v的身影
So you can see at many , many different occasions that you will see glimpses of body of v

1039
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,840
例如
So for example

1040
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,740
你坐过的每部动画
Every animation you sit on

1041
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,060
你在场景中的某个地方被挡住了
And you get blocked somewhere in the scene

1042
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,650
你总是看到相机有点下降
You always see like the camera goes a little bit down

1043
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,630
你看到腿了
You see the legs

1044
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,010
你知道，就像坐下来
You know , like sitting down

1045
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,530
然后它又恢复了
And then it goes back up again

1046
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,220
所以你总是有上下文
So you always have context

1047
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,000
你的身体发生了什么
What is happening with your body

1048
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,410
实际上，例如，所有亲爱的免费场景
Actually , for example , all the dear free scenes

1049
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,850
当你靠在某物上并且可以自由拍摄时
The one when you sert or lean on something and you have freedom of camera

1050
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,120
我们总是离开相机的自由
We always left the freedom of cameras

1051
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,860
所以只要你能看到你的身体发生了什么就足够了
So it's enough that you can see what's happening with your body

1052
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,340
因为我们在某些迭代中有类似的东西，但我们没有
Because we had like at some iterations , we didn't have it

1053
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,970
感觉超级奇怪
And it was super weird feeling like

1054
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,250
但我这是怎么了
But what's happening with me

1055
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,530
为什么我不能动
Why cannot i move

1056
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,250
哦，我不能
Oh , i cannot

1057
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,410
所以，呃，好吧
So , uh , okay

1058
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,490
因为我坐着。好的
Because i'm sitting . okay

1059
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,410
现在有道理了
Now it makes sense

1060
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,620
突然间你就进入了角色，嗯
And suddenly you're in the character , um

1061
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,760
但一直待在体内也需要我们
But staying all the time inside the body also required us

1062
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,100
有时尝试想出创造性的解决方案
Sometimes to do like try to think of creative solutions

1063
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,590
如何逃离这个身体
How to escape this body

1064
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,167
但总是
But always

1065
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,470
呃，就像逻辑这个词一样
Uh , like within the word logic

1066
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,560
然后就呆在里面
And staying like , well , um , in inside

1067
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,160
你知道，网络朋克的世界
You know , the world of cyber pank

1068
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,520
以及技术的运作方式
And the way the technology works

1069
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,512
等等，例如，这是其中一个案例
And so on here , here is , for example , one of those cases

1070
00:42:43,512 --> 00:42:47,770
呃，就像你在不同的房间里移动蜘蛛机器人一样
Uh , where like you move the spider bot around like different rooms

1071
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,540
而且你用相机
And you use cameras

1072
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,040
所以实际上你并不在你的身体里
So actually you're not inside your body

1073
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,580
现在你有不同的观点
Right now you have different perspective

1074
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,710
突然我们在某种程度上添加了，呃
Suddenly we added , uh , in a way

1075
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,210
但还是有道理的
But still it makes sense

1076
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:00,530
这不是创作者级别的任意元选择
It's not an arbitrary meta choice from the level of creator

1077
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,130
这一切都是按照这个世界的方式来合理的，呃
It's all justified by the way the world does , uh

1078
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,410
大脑是，呃，同样的东西
The brain ances is the , uh , the same thing

1079
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:10,410
我们有这样的序列，你扮演约翰，呃
We have this sequences where you play as john , uh

1080
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,430
但同样，它发生在
But again , it kind of happens in

1081
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,390
这个头实际上就像我们生活在回忆中
And this head actually it's like we're living the memories

1082
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,250
部分原因是它实际上是基于像在记忆中潦草地写的那样
And part of it is actually it's really based in like the like scrawling through the memories

1083
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,690
这么说吧，好吧
Let's say so , okay

1084
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,490
你改变你的身体
You change your body

1085
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:23,690
现在是不同的视角了
It's a different perspective now

1086
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,210
但还是有道理的
But still it makes sense

1087
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:28,490
我认为重要的是要注意
I think it's important to note that

1088
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:32,590
在游戏中拥有身体并不是一个显而易见的选择
Having a body inside a game is not really an obvious choice

1089
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,090
因为它增加了疯狂的复杂性和直接问题
Because it adds insane amount of complexity and straight up problems

1090
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,400
当你想到这一点时
When you think about this

1091
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,070
因为到最后
Because at the end of the day

1092
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:43,130
你不是恰好在某个地方的漂浮相机
You are not the floating camera that just happens to be somewhere

1093
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,860
你知道，你的身体实际上必须适应这个空间
You actually have the body that has to , you know , fit in the space

1094
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,740
必须真正穿过空间
Have to actually move toward through through the space

1095
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,190
正确的
Right

1096
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,530
我认为我们使用的令人惊奇的调整之一
I think one of the amazing tweaks that we use

1097
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,390
也许这是非常罕见的事情
Maybe it's something that's pretty rare

1098
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,470
所以基本上我们在相机上有一个视差
So basically we have a parallex on the camera

1099
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,240
所以当你真正坐下并旋转相机时
So when you actually sit that and you rotate the camera

1100
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,580
这不像愚蠢的 T 部分，只从同一位置旋转相机
This is not like the stupid t section that only rotates the camera from the same spot

1101
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,940
你实际上在太空中移动相机
You actually move the the camera in space

1102
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,580
所以如果你愿意的话，如果你看看它
So if you will , if you look at it

1103
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,690
你会发现事物的位置实际上发生了移动
You will see that the the position of of things actually kind of move

1104
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,970
当你轮换时，不同的植物会发生变化
When you rotate the different plants change

1105
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,550
因为你还有翻译
Because you have also translation

1106
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,570
就像我们的眼睛一样
Just as our eyes

1107
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:23,610
它们的头部并不完全是数学上的零
They are not where the head is exactly such a mathematical zero

1108
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,960
你知道，在之前的大部分比赛中
And you know , in most of the previous games

1109
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,220
事实上，当你看它的时候
Actually , when you look at it

1110
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,220
当你旋转时，你旋转了这个精确的数学点
When you rotate , you rotating this exact mathematical spot

1111
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,700
所以背景给人的感觉是，呃，感觉很平坦
So the background it feels , uh , it feels flat

1112
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,600
因为在我们的游戏中元素不会在视差中移动
Because the elements don't move in the parallax in our game

1113
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,880
当你旋转头部时，即使坐在原位
When you rotate the head even sitting in place

1114
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,220
不同的植物会改变它们之间的关系
The different plants will change their like own relationships

1115
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:42,910
因为是的
Because yeah

1116
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:46,800
我们有这样的，甚至这样的设置，u um
We had this and even setting like this , u , um

1117
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,740
呃，这个视差弧
Uh , this arc for the parallex

1118
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,300
那么相机是如何移动的
So how does the camera move

1119
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,630
那么它是这样移动的吗
So does it move like this

1120
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,870
还是像这样移动
Or does it move like this

1121
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,150
还是像这样移动
Or does it move like this

1122
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,830
等等本身就像一个挑战
And so on was like a challenge on its own

1123
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:02,110
当感觉就像超级乌戈一样正确时
When it felt right in a way that's like super ugo

1124
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:02,580
是的
Yeah

1125
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,820
听到这真是太有根据了
It's so basing to hear about

1126
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,020
因为当你玩的时候你会感受到这一切
Because you feel all this when you're playing it

1127
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,070
但你不自觉地明白
But you don't consciously understand

1128
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,580
为什么你有这样的感觉
Why you feel that way

1129
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,140
是的
Yeah

1130
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,410
视觉效果很棒，呃，就像《巫师》一样
Great visible , uh , and like just the same way as with witcher

1131
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:17,610
基本上所有的内容和郊区都是完全定制的
Basically all the content and suburbank is completely custom made

1132
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,250
它的手手工创建，正确的
Its hand hand created , right

1133
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,540
所以哪一年我们有四到五个 Cyber​​pank 设计师
So in which year we had like four to five designers for cyberpank

1134
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,260
现在我们有十八个
Right now we have eighteen

1135
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,540
以及复杂性和工作量
And the amount of complexity and , and the work

1136
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,220
你必须真正做到让这项工作变得疯狂
You have to actually make to make this work is just crazy

1137
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,580
但我认为我们是，你知道的
But i think we are , you know

1138
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,780
我们正在穿孔，需要几个小时
We are piercing it'll take a couple hours

1139
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,310
这里很小，很小，有点疯狂，呃
Tiny , tiny , tiny bit crazy here , uh

1140
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,010
因为他们正在做这样的事情，对吧
Because they're doing something like this , right

1141
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:43,080
所以食物长期伴随着身体呈现
So the food long be all the way with body presents with

1142
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,400
有阴影，有万物互动
With shadows , with interactions on everything

1143
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,540
所以你永远不会真正传送到某个动作之间具有疯狂连续性的地方
So you never actually teleport somewhere with crazy amount of continuity between the action

1144
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,320
因为如果我们确实在故事中非常特定的地方进行了编辑
Because if we do have edits there in very particular places in the story

1145
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,370
但通常你有这个线性，呃
But normally you have this linear , uh

1146
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,920
超高保真解说
Super high fidelity narration

1147
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,110
同时
And at the same time

1148
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,230
例如，您可以跳过场景之类的事情
You have things like , for example , skipping scenes

1149
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,080
哪个存在于世间且不会消失
Which is in the world and does not fade out

1150
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,980
淡入故事中的其他地方
Fade into some other place in the story

1151
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,060
您基本上只是观看相同赛事的加速版本
You just basically watch a speed up version of the same events

1152
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,980
这本身实际上是一项成熟的技术
Which which in itself is actually a full born technology that

1153
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,500
你知道，我们必须设计、发明、原型
You know , we have to design , invent , prototype

1154
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,040
人们必须这样做，这太疯狂了
People had to make this it's it's it's crazy

1155
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,820
我我喜欢它
I i love it

1156
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,520
别误会我的意思
Don't get me wrong

1157
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:20,920
我喜欢它
I love it

1158
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,590
但是是的
But yeah

1159
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,500
你没有让自己变得容易
You did not make it easy for yourselves

1160
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,000
是的
Yeah

1161
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,560
不 。不，你知道我知道发生了什么事
No . don't , you know that i know what what's going on

1162
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,660
但我们总是尽力让这变得更加
But we always though always try to make this the more

1163
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,760
你知道，我们最后可以加入疯狂有趣的东西，对吧
You know , crazy fun stuff that we can in at the end , right

1164
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,200
呃
Uh

1165
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:34,360
是的
Yeah

1166
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,900
然后，呃，就像人们之前提到过的那样
And then , uh , like people mentioned this before

1167
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,780
就像这是一次疯狂的努力
Like it was a crazy more effort

1168
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,300
事实上你有这个连续体实际上还在继续
And the fact that you have this continuit actually continue

1169
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,760
这是你拥有的最昂贵的东西
It is the most expensive thing you have

1170
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,740
所以当你用这种经典的电影语言
So when you in this classic cinematic language

1171
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,260
你跳到特写
You jump to a close up

1172
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,100
所以此时此刻，唯一的事情
So in this moment , the only thing

1173
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,260
你必须为这个特写而感动和哭泣
You have to animate and cry about is this close up

1174
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,860
而这个角色就在这里
And this one character right here

1175
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,110
如果你有这样的没有完整
If you have like this no full

1176
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,380
比如说广角镜头中的相机控制
Let's say like camera control in a wide shot as well

1177
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,320
有时现在只有杰基
And sometimes right now it's only jackie

1178
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,640
但我们也有类似的场景，你知道
But we have scenes with like , you know

1179
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,680
免费四五个字符等等
Free four or five characters and so on

1180
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,370
你需要管理这一切
And you need to manage all that

1181
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:11,640
你不能只是想把某人从现场赶走
You cannot just like dispt someone from the scene

1182
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,660
你知道，当玩家向左看时
You know , when the player is looking to the left

1183
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,780
事实上我们和约翰尼一起做
Actually we do it with johnny

1184
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,560
但假设他有一个特殊的地方纽约猫
But let's say he has like a special place new york cat

1185
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,440
所以我们会看到，当你不再看约翰尼时，他总是消失
So we'll see that johnny always disappears when you stop looking at him

1186
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,760
就像你转身一样
Like you turn around

1187
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,440
你把他的枪转回来
You turn back his gun

1188
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,630
但是为了，呃
But for , uh

1189
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,310
我可以继续说一些离题的话，比如我们如何介绍
I could go on tangents about like how we introduce

1190
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,230
就像乔纳斯一样，精疲力尽
And like sponning and spent out jonas

1191
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,340
单独设计的自我，嗯
The separate design self , um

1192
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,440
但还是喜欢制作
But still like making

1193
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,160
你知道，当你想让npc出现在场景中时，要确保这种情况
You know , securing the situation that when you want npc in in the scene

1194
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,780
他其实需要从夏天一路过来
He actually needs to come from summer all the way

1195
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,660
坐下
Sit down

1196
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,570
和你说话，搬进衣服上去
Talk with you , move into the clothes up

1197
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,770
你知道，emt与脸有关
You know , emt with the face

1198
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,050
然后站起来一路走到外面
And then get up and walk all the way out there

1199
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,830
而你就让他消失了
And you just kind of disappear him

1200
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,090
而且这个时候也不像切割啊,呃
And at this time it's also not like cutting , uh

1201
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,330
npc和玩家之间来回
Between npc and player back and forth

1202
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:59,950
因此，就像您只有有限数量的动画和信息可供出售一样
So at the same like you have just a limited amount of like animation and information to sell

1203
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,850
如果你的镜头中有NPC
If you have npc that's in your shot

1204
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,550
你知道，你不能只是坐着，一动不动
You cannot be just like sitting , you know , static

1205
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,470
他有时需要移动，这样做
He needs to move sometimes do this

1206
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,500
回去吧，你知道的
Go back like , you know

1207
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,420
他做了一些东西
And he makes something

1208
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,300
他基本上需要生活
He needs to live basically

1209
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,920
不仅喜欢动画的连续性
And like also doing it not only like continuity of animation

1210
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,640
但实时完成这一切也是一个问题
But also doing it all in a real time is an issue

1211
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,770
因为话又说回来，当你想要场景时，例如
Because then again , when you want the scene , for example

1212
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,970
我们演奏了分数现场
We played the score poscene

1213
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:27,130
例如，你和杰基以及对饮料发表评论的女孩坐下来
And you sit down with jackie and the girl with the drinks comment , for example

1214
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,690
或者稍后暴徒进来
Or later the goons come in

1215
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,380
他们需要从像
And they need to go from like

1216
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,080
从这个遥远的地方来到你身边
Come to you from this like distant part of location

1217
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,820
你实际上可以在 lizzi 中看到远处的门
And you can actually see how the door far away in lizzi

1218
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,120
但他们敞开心扉，一路走来
But they open , they walk all the way

1219
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,680
但从我们的电影来看
But from our cinematic

1220
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,580
假设过去需要完美的时机和节奏来实现这一切
Let's say perspective used to need the perfect timing and pacing for all of this

1221
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,310
所以我们需要喜欢，你知道，适应它
So we need to like , you know , adjust for it

1222
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:46,530
好的
Okay

1223
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,050
因此，例如，他们需要大约三十五秒才能到达这里
So it will take them like thirty five seconds to get here , for example

1224
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,140
当杰基喜欢的时候他们就会来
And they will come exactly when jackie is like

1225
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,540
哦，现在他们打断了我等等
Oh , now they're interrupted me and so on

1226
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,420
但你知道，你不只是按照镜头剪辑那样做
But you didn't just do it like , you know , along the camera edit

1227
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,450
哦，他们在这里，这非常简单。所以是的
Oh they're here it's super simple . so yeah

1228
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:07,590
像这样连续拍摄是一件很难做到的事情
This like this continuous camera shot is it was such a difficult thing to do

1229
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:10,470
所以你有点抱歉
So you something i oh sorry

1230
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,400
对不起
Sorry

1231
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,130
哦不
Oh no

1232
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:12,410
是的
Yeah

1233
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,957
呃，继续
Uh , continue

1234
00:49:13,957 --> 00:49:16,100
呃，以公寓为例
Uh , here the apartment , for example

1235
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,680
另一个案例
Another case

1236
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,850
我不知道，呃，呃
I don't know , uh , uh

1237
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,770
在这种情况下，哪些生命部件在正常情况下做出反应
Which life parts are replying in this case in norma

1238
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,330
我认为你有一个很好的，呃
You have a good one , i think , uh

1239
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:23,990
你也可以评论它
And you can comment on it as well

1240
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:24,680
没关系
Never mind

1241
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,500
所以英雄去公寓
So hero going to the apartment

1242
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,930
你应该去保险箱
And you should go to the safe

1243
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,390
呃，杰基所在的地方
Uh , place where jackie

1244
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,390
所以当然那里有一个任务标记。杰基·兰斯在那里
So of course there's like a quest marker there . jackie lans there

1245
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,100
去那里感觉有点明显
It feels kind of obvious to go there

1246
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,300
但你也可以对 guana 发表评论
But you can comment on the guana as well

1247
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,890
你可以去找你的无能者，呃
You can go to your inables , uh

1248
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:39,690
床并从那里拿枪
The bed and take a gun from there

1249
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,150
后面还有评论
And there's a comment back there

1250
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,860
如果你这么做了又怎样
So what if you do it

1251
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,280
就在杰基说另一句话的时候
Exactly when jackie is saying a different line

1252
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,280
是否应该中断
Should it interrupt

1253
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,700
你应该让他完成吗
Should you should he finished

1254
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,860
但如果你说完然后你说的话听起来不像是一个正确的对话
But if you finishes and then you say it like it doesn't sound like a correct dialogue

1255
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,800
所以也许中间应该有一条连接线之类的
So maybe there should be like a connection line in the middle and so on

1256
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,520
但大多数人都看不到
But most of the pairs won't see it

1257
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,940
因为他们只会做其他事情
Because they will just do something else

1258
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,180
否则他们不会到达这个确切的位置
Or they will not hit this exact spot

1259
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,140
当你击中它时
Where when you hit it

1260
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,700
然后就像发生了不同的事情
Then like different things happen

1261
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,240
从付款人的角度来看，这又是不可察觉的
And again it's imperceivable from the payer perspective

1262
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,500
对于玩家来说应该永远都是这样完美、流畅、易懂的体验
For players should always be just like this perfect , fluent , understandable experience

1263
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,520
是的
Yeah

1264
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,230
哇
Wow

1265
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:16,860
一
Um

1266
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,160
是的
Yeah

1267
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,780
我这这位老人最近特别重播
I this , this seniin particular replaying it recently

1268
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:24,610
你知道，这让我震惊，因为它完成了我认为在电影中的事情
This struck me as , you know , accomplishing something that i think in cinema

1269
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:28,500
您经常通过长镜头或不间断的单镜头来完成
You often accomplished with a long take or an unbroken single take

1270
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,630
哪一个是紧张和悬念
Which is tension and suspense

1271
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,470
而且，你知道，我想到了一部类似《人类之子》的电影
And , you know , i think about a movie like children of men

1272
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:36,670
在那里你有这些非常长的不间断的长镜头
Where you have these really long unbroken long takes

1273
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:39,180
它会让你体重增加
And it makes you weigh more

1274
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,830
呃，担心角色
Uh , afraid for the characters

1275
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,870
因为割伤或感觉不安全
Because there's no safety in cuts or feeling like

1276
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:47,590
哦，也许编辑会以某种方式保存这些字符，比如，不
Oh , maybe somehow the edit will save these characters like , no

1277
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,850
我们被困在这种纪录片风格中
We're locked in in this documentary style

1278
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,182
而且，尤其是当抢劫案开始出现问题时
And , and especially when things start to go wrong here with the heist

1279
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:56,120
事实上，我们已经建立了这种连续的
The fact that we've established this continuous

1280
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,430
你无法逃脱这种长镜头风格
You can't escape it kind of long take style

1281
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,250
我认为确实加剧了紧张气氛
I think really amps up the tension

1282
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:01,730
一
Um

1283
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,990
你也可能会谈论这个吗
And so did you might talk about that

1284
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,312
你怎么样，如果你想过的话
How you , if you thought about

1285
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:07,980
这是如何连续的第一人称视角，呃
How this continuous first person perspective , uh

1286
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,090
你实际上也将它用于无法逃脱的电影技巧
You were using it actually also for the cinematic technique of no escape

1287
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,250
你被锁在
You are locked in

1288
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,620
这是实时的
This is real time

1289
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,210
呃
Uh

1290
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:15,930
你知道，在某种程度上
You know , in a way

1291
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,910
这是你免费获得的东西
It's something you get for free

1292
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:20,510
更重要的是你无法真正逃脱它
And even more you can't really escape it

1293
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,910
因为一旦我们采用这个设计
Because once we go with this design

1294
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,390
我们得到了一切酷炫的东西
We get everything that's like cool coming with it

1295
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:27,100
所有这些，你知道，也有缺点，呃
And all that , you know , downsides , uh , as well

1296
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,860
所以从某种意义上说它起作用了
So in some sense it worked

1297
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,180
但例如，在其他方面
But for example , in others

1298
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,880
事实上你只有副总裁是有问题的
The fact that you had just vp was problematic

1299
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,220
因为也只是为了打断你的身体存在
Because also just to interrupt your body presence

1300
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,700
看到一只手像这样移动
See a hand moving like along this

1301
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,300
甚至更多。所以现在你会到达这里，还有一只手在你面前
and even more . so now you will get here there's also a hand in front of you

1302
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,250
只是为了提醒您，您处于什么样的环境中
Just to remind you like what kind of context you are in

1303
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,730
也在这里，例如
And also here , for example

1304
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,270
当我们没有这只手的时候
When we didn't have this hand

1305
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,500
感觉真的很奇怪。就像你只是太空中的这个浮点，没有参考
It felt really weird . like you were just this floating point in space without reference

1306
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,700
坐下来感觉超级舒服
And sit felt like super off

1307
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,020
你加上这手牌，突然间你就完全领先了
You add this hand and suddenly you're totally total leader

1308
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,700
一
Um

1309
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,060
例如，这个场景是关键情节点之一
And for example , this scene is one of the crucial plot points

1310
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,300
就整个故事来说
Let's say in the whole story

1311
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,460
所以我们觉得有必要
So it felt necessary for us

1312
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,180
它至少需要是无钢的
It needs to be at least this steel free with like

1313
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,140
你知道，你的焦点就在你面前
You know , your focus here in front of you

1314
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,420
你需要感知它
You need to perceive it

1315
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,620
我们不能给你自由
We cannot give you a freedom

1316
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,850
例如旋转一百八十度
For example , rotating one hundred and eighty degrees

1317
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,120
这太重要了
This is too important

1318
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,560
就像从我们的角度来看
Like from our perspective

1319
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,240
我们需要确保您看到它
We need to be sure that you see it

1320
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,610
就像，呃，呃，同时感知到
And like , uh , uh , perceived at , at the same time

1321
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:26,140
我们试着留下一点，嗯
We try to leave a little like , um

1322
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,960
呃，玩家的互动性
Uh , interactivity for the players

1323
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,600
例如，当你看这件夹克时
So when you look at the jacket , for example

1324
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,120
我，呃
I , uh

1325
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,400
你应该看看你
You should look at you for

1326
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,960
呃，应该可以吗
Uh , should it work

1327
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,690
也许现在还不是这个时刻
Maybe it's not this exact moment

1328
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,370
因为我认为他在照顾明天
Because i think he was looking after tomorrow

1329
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,280
哦这里，看，看，像你一样
Oh here , look , look , look as you

1330
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,580
你看着他时会有这样的反应
It's such a reaction to you looking at him

1331
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,150
但如果你不看着他，这一切就不会发生
But it wouldn't happen if you didn't look at him

1332
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:47,350
嗯，我们在这里，呃，呃，也是takora的方式，呃
Um , here we , uh , uh , also the way that takora , uh

1333
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,820
Takara takura 消失在画框后面
The takara takura disappears like behind the frame

1334
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,180
然后突然出现在你面前
And then suddenly appears just in front of you

1335
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,720
这是我们可以用这种有限的视角做的很酷的事情之一
It's one of the cool things we can do with like this limited perspective

1336
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,240
呃，嗯，就像我们如何利用它一样
Uh , um , like how we can utilize that

1337
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,560
你知道，创造，呃，创造戏剧
You know , to create , uh , to create drama

1338
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,760
但现在回到我之前的想法
But now going back to my previous thought

1339
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,260
所以有时候紧张是很酷的
So sometimes it's cool for tension

1340
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,880
像你一样，你无法逃脱，你是
Like you , you cannot escape , you are

1341
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,582
你知道，在这个地方。等等
You know , in this spot . and so on

1342
00:53:08,582 --> 00:53:11,990
但有时候，当你们的谈话时间较长时，例如
But sometimes when you have longer conversations that , for example

1343
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,830
是更多的阐述而不是情感的沉重
Are a bit more exposition rather than emotion is heavy

1344
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,030
这成为一个问题
It becomes a problem

1345
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:20,890
因为内容越长，对玩家的吸引力就越低
Because the content , it can become less attractive for the player the longer it goes

1346
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,920
因为你没有这么酷
Because you don't have all this cool

1347
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,720
你知道，视觉效果来自不同的相机共享
You know , visuals coming from different camera shares

1348
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,820
发送、编辑等
Send , edit , and so on

1349
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,160
所以球员有时可以，你知道，那些在外的球员
So players sometimes can , you know , those away

1350
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,145
然后我们需要
And then we need to

1351
00:53:31,145 --> 00:53:33,210
呃，比如让它更有吸引力
Uh , make it more attractive , for example

1352
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:38,200
在动画层面上时刻保持内容一定程度的吸引力
On the level of animation to keep a certain level of attractivity of content at all times

1353
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,850
所以如果场景很长并且很重要
So if there's a long scene and it's important

1354
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,550
而你被锁在一个地方
And you are locked in one spot

1355
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,950
我们需要投入更多资金，以其他方式使其更具吸引力
We need to invest more into making it attractive in some other way

1356
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:46,910
也许有背景
Maybe with the background

1357
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:47,790
也许随着灯光
Maybe with the lighting

1358
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,070
也许有某种效果
Maybe with some kind of effex

1359
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,750
可能是和角色的表演有关
Maybe with the character staging

1360
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,270
时间越来越长，在一个地方持续的时间越来越长
And so long and the longer it goes in one spot

1361
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:57,440
越长越需要开头也有这个场景
The longer the , the more you needed there's this scene at the beginning as well

1362
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,150
嗯，在，呃，至少当你心情低落的时候是这样
Um , in the , uh , at least this when you're down at judbasement

1363
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,450
并且在很长一段时间里
And for a really long time

1364
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,070
你坐在这把椅子上
You are sitting in this chair

1365
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,840
你可以看到伊芙琳的动作有多么像
And you can see how much like evelyn is moving

1366
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,400
朱迪来回移动并再次回到你身边
Judy is moving back and forth and back to you again

1367
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,340
因为如果他们只是在同一个地方
Because if they were just in the same spots

1368
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,352
尽管这是一个有趣的序列
Even though it's an interesting sequence

1369
00:54:13,352 --> 00:54:16,000
它，它就变成了，实际上我们有这个
It , it just became , and actually we had this

1370
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,200
变得有点乏味
It became a little bit tedious

1371
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,540
例如，后来我们添加了伊芙琳
So for example , later we added eveline

1372
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,510
拿起杯子并像与 deo 一样移动
Getting cup and moving like alongside deo

1373
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,970
还因为框架比 更宽，呃
Also because the frame is wider than , uh

1374
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,970
用一张相机拍摄就能看到什么
What you can see in like with one camera shot

1375
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,010
所以你要么看到今天，要么看到伊芙琳
So you can either see today or evelyn

1376
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,010
如果你非常关注朱迪
And if you pay a lot of attention to judy

1377
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,650
我们需要提醒您现场的证据
We needed to remind you that evidence in scene as well

1378
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,300
于是她起身
So she got up

1379
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,180
来回走在你面前
Walked in front of you back and forth

1380
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,180
因为她不耐烦所以有动力
And it's motivated because she's impatient

1381
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,210
她想要效果或者什么
She wants effects or , or something

1382
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,900
但是，嗯
But , um

1383
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,510
但是是的
But yeah

1384
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:45,390
我不知道它要去哪里
I don't know where it's going

1385
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,450
但是，呃，这个想法
But , uh , the thought

1386
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,550
但是，呃，还是，嗯
But , uh , still , um

1387
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:51,010
保留内容的要点
The point of keeping the content

1388
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:55,350
对于 fbp 设计来说，始终具有吸引力确实至关重要
Attractive at all times was really crucial for this fbp design

1389
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:56,330
因为我们失去了一些东西
Because we lose something

1390
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:59,710
所以我们需要想办法弥补
So we need to somehow make up for it

1391
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:06,380
所以我们通常可以使用的最大工具当然是交互性和反应性，对吧
So of course to biggest tools that we can use normally are interactivity and reactivity , right

1392
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,950
因此，交互性是指你实际上可以做一些对世界有益的事情
So interactivity is when you actually can do something that is towards the world

1393
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,290
反应性是你需要相反的方式
And reactivity is you need the other way around

1394
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,710
所以言语会对你所做的一切做出反应
So words react to you doing whatever

1395
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,530
这实际上是一个有趣的例子
This is actually an interesting example

1396
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,810
因为理论上
Because in theory

1397
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:20,650
这是一个非常被动的场景吧
This is a very passive scene , right

1398
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,610
你基本上已经脚踏实地了
You are basically grounded in the situation

1399
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,617
也许因为你正站在这个非常
Maybe because you are standing in this very

1400
00:55:26,617 --> 00:55:27,320
呃
Uh

1401
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,140
精致，呃，有的地方，有的地方，呃
Delicate , uh , spots to be , to be in , uh

1402
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,710
不过，如果你观察玩家对这个场景的反应，就会发现，速度很快
Still , if you watch how players react to this scene , it's it's , it's fast

1403
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,740
他们认为，你知道
They think that , you know

1404
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,300
他们深吸一口气
They take a deep breath

1405
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,740
当 takaoa 真正接近时
When takaoa is actually close

1406
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,440
离玻璃非常非常近
Very , very close to the , to the glass

1407
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,520
他们实际上对这些聋人做出反应
They actually react to , to , to , to these deaf

1408
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,237
我认为是，呃
I i think it's , uh

1409
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:46,030
我想当它起作用时
I think when it works

1410
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:48,410
效果真的非常好
It works really , really well

1411
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:49,060
呃
Uh

1412
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,980
这是我想触摸他们的东西
And this is something i wanted to touch them

1413
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,860
因为我们，我们发现，我猜，呃
Because we , we discovered , i guess , uh

1414
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,180
这种沉浸感使一切倍增
That immersion multiplies everything

1415
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,070
因此，如果您有精彩的内容呈现在玩家面前
So if you have a great content in front of the player

1416
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:02,310
然后他们实际上非常投入
Then they actually are extremely engaged

1417
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:07,310
如果你真的给他们一些东西去做一些非常有趣、有吸引力、有趣的事情
If you actually give them something to do something very fun , engaging , interesting

1418
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,250
他们继续参与游戏
They stay engaged with the game

1419
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,200
他们非常融入体验之中
And they are very much inside the inside the experience

1420
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,220
另一方面，当你不再拥有那样的东西时
On the other hand , when you don't have that again

1421
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,940
沉浸让一切倍增
Immersion multiplies everything

1422
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,280
所以你可能会遇到很大的问题
So you can have very big problems

1423
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,240
如果有什么事，你知道
If something just , you know

1424
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,560
玩得不好
Does does not play well

1425
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:21,960
正确的
Right

1426
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,040
因为归根结底，这只是一场游戏
Because at the end of the day , it's a game

1427
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,300
我们需要能够玩这个游戏
We need to be able to play this game

1428
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,180
甚至在这个特别的时刻
And even this in this specifically a moment

1429
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,750
这种互动量
This amount of interactivity

1430
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,470
所以玩家实际上可以移动相机
So player actually you can move the camera

1431
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,380
并且，你知道，制定行动
And , you know , frame the action

1432
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,660
他们想要如何构建它很重要
How they want to frame it is important

1433
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,320
它实际上运作得足够好
It actually works well enough

1434
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,100
所以玩家仍然在这个游戏中
So the player is still inside this game

1435
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,030
他们相信正在发生的事情
They believe in what's happening

1436
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,030
他们，他们感觉是对的
They , they feel it right

1437
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,710
他们实际上是这整个经历中的演员
They actually are actor inside this , this whole experience

1438
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:52,420
不仅是从这里出发的观察者能够看到
Not only an observer that goes from this got eyes view

1439
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,470
你知道，看着蚂蚁光滑地走
You know , watching as the ants smooth

1440
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,190
不，他们实际上正处于其中
No , they actually are in the middle of it

1441
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:57,370
他们
They

1442
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,790
好吧，他们充当玩家
Well , they act as the player

1443
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,270
作为玩家颜色角色
As the player color character

1444
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,310
不是相反
Not the other way around

1445
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,190
一、和、一
Um , and , um

1446
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,312
一
Um

1447
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:06,940
对于，呃，对于，例如
For , uh , for , for example

1448
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,020
，这个就像这样工作
The , the this like for this to work

1449
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,340
你需要资金才能让玩家站在学校的角度
You need dough to put the player in the school perspective

1450
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,340
哪个有吸引力
Which is attractive for

1451
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,060
例如
So for example

1452
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,120
我记得场景的第一次迭代
I remember that the first iterations of the scene

1453
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,310
我们看着整个事件，就像从一本杂志上想象谋杀案一样
We were watching the whole like think of the murder from like a magazine

1454
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,970
这就是我们这样称呼它的，你知道，半地板
This how we call it like this , you know , semi floor

1455
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:28,040
让我们说通过一些，嗯，通过一些东西
Let's say through some like , um , like through something

1456
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,260
而且他们真的很远
And they were really far away

1457
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,340
而且场景没有发挥作用
And the scene didn't work

1458
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,760
因为真的很长
Because it's really long

1459
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,240
我想大概持续了四分钟
Like it goes for like four minutes , i think

1460
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,310
当角色很小的时候，呃
And when the characters are small , uh

1461
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,030
就在那里，你就在那里，呃
And out there and you are , uh

1462
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,230
你知道，就像被迫一样，观看它
You know , like forced to , to watch it

1463
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,540
它突然变成了一种非常沉闷的经历
It suddenly became a really dull experience

1464
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,740
所以我们需要，我们需要发明一些东西来让你尽可能接近动作
So we need , we needed to invent something to bring you as close to the action as possible

1465
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,580
还有那面威尼斯镜子，呃，呃，呃，主意
And hands that venetian mirror , uh , uh , uh , idea

1466
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,200
以及它的案例
And the case by it

1467
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,670
正是这样的情况，就像这里面的一些人所做的那样
It was exactly cases like those were like some people in this to do it

1468
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,610
就像 fpp 无法工作一样
Like no way fpp can work

1469
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,190
因为就像你怎样才能做到
Because like how can you do it

1470
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:05,240
但事实证明，你可以通过对不同事物的相似观点获得真正的创造力，嗯
But then it turns out you can get really creative with like points of view on different things , um

1471
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,080
而且只要内容和故事实际上是有创意的
And also as long as actually the content and stories is creative

1472
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,355
也喜欢玩家可以，嗯，嗯
Also like players can , um , um

00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:15,360
呃呃呃比赛ch呃
Uh , uh , uh , the match ch , uh

1474
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,720
你可以像很多人一样原谅你，呃
You can forgive you like a lot of , uh

1475
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:23,340
很多事情有时甚至可能不是你实际上会做的最合乎逻辑的事情
A lot of things sometimes even it's not maybe the most logical thing that you would actually do

1476
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,960
从外面观看这一切
And watching this in from outside

1477
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,800
但如果它对我有吸引力呢
But what if it's attractive for me

1478
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,160
喜欢它的作品。人们并没有真正考虑过它
Like it works . people don't really think about it

1479
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,390
我觉得这很酷
And i think it's cool

1480
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,100
是的
Yeah

1481
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:31,550
是的
Yeah

1482
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,560
我是说，我，我记得这个场景就像
I mean , i , i remember this scene being like a

1483
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,140
就像我脑子里有一件大事
Like a big deal in my brain

1484
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,040
我第一次玩的时候，就像我一样
The first time i was playing it , like i

1485
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,100
我真的很喜欢它
I was really into it

1486
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,180
我真的很享受
I was really enjoying it

1487
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,760
但当那一幕发生时
But when that scene happened

1488
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,850
我想那是我开始喜欢充分欣赏的时候，呃
I think that's when i started to like fully appreciate , uh

1489
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:50,810
所有这些事情如何结合在一起创造了这种被困的体验
How all these things were coming together to create this experience of feeling trapped

1490
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:53,030
感觉就像我不能你知道，我无法移动
Feeling like i can't you know , i can't move

1491
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,020
我发不出声音
I can't make a sound

1492
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,620
我和杰基在这里
I'm in here with jackie

1493
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,860
就像我非常感受到那种存在
Like i very much feel that presence

1494
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,150
然后也像你说的那样欣赏
And then also appreciating like you were saying

1495
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,730
亚历克斯是那种擅长长镜头的人
Alex is the kind of long take kness of this

1496
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,760
这么长的时间里发生了很多事情
It is this long seeing where a lot happens

1497
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,200
人们进进出出
People come in and out

1498
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
这是一个感人至深的呻吟场景
It's a moan emotional scene

1499
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,475
有人死了，就像所有这一切都以不间断的方式发生一样
somebody dies like all of that happening in an unbroken way

1500
00:59:13,475 --> 00:59:16,700
表演必须喜欢流动
Where the performances have to like flow

1501
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,250
总的来说，没有删减，没有作弊
Altogether there's no cuts there's no cheating

1502
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,057
一
Um

1503
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:20,470
是的
Yeah

1504
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:21,270
我就是这么感觉
I just feel like that

1505
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,550
这对我来说是第一个华丽的时刻
That was the first like flashy moment for me

1506
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:24,470
我就像，哦哇
I'm like , oh wow

1507
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:28,290
如果你继续玩这个游戏，这就像你所期待的那样
This is like what you are in store for if you keep playing this game

1508
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,390
我真的真的很感激
And i just really , really appreciate it

1509
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,810
明确涉及此的所有工作
All the work clearly that went into this

1510
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,755
是的
Yeah

1511
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:34,310
正确的
Right

1512
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:36,850
就像我一样，我作为一名球员突然意识到了
Like i , i as a player suddenly became conscious of like

1513
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,070
哦我，我开始明白这里发生了什么
Oh i , i'm starting to see what's happening here

1514
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:44,230
这就像我以前从未经历过的真正的第一人称体验
This is like a true first person experience in a way that i don't think i've had before

1515
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,470
并且，并且看到了。是的
And , and that seen . yeah

1516
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,690
这就像一个结晶时刻，这就是可能的
It was like a crystallization moment of this is what's possible

1517
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,955
当你致力于这种不间断的体验时
When you commit to this unbroken experience

1518
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:56,000
嗯，不过很酷，呃，我认为这对每个人来说都不是非常直观
Um , cool though , uh , i think it wasn't super intuitive for everyone

1519
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,280
例如，很有趣
For example , was interesting

1520
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,930
我喜欢看很多信任游戏
I like i watched a ton of played trust

1521
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,730
就像我喜欢看人们如何玩游戏一样
Like i love to watch how people play the game

1522
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,210
我也从中学到了
And also i learned from it like

1523
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,260
我们可以改进什么，呃，下次更好
What could we improve , uh , better next time

1524
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,180
比如说，在《甜蜜的索拉》中
And for example , in the sweet sora

1525
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,880
我看到很多人们喜欢的地方
I saw plenty of play rose where people like

1526
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,990
它们挤在相机内部就像居中关闭一样
They squeeze inside the camera is like centered shut

1527
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,950
他们在整个场景中都保持这样的状态
And they leave it like this throughout rest of the scene

1528
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,570
他们不喜欢碰这样的东西
They don't like touch them such thing

1529
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:20,240
有时他们可能喜欢触摸，你知道，那根小鸟的棍子
Sometimes they like maybe touch the , you know , the stick a little bird

1530
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,340
就像刷新一样
So like it's refresh

1531
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,620
但他们却真的跟着行动。等等
But they really follow the action . and so on

1532
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,925
所以我觉得，嗯
So i feel that , um

1533
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:27,620
其实我不知道我对此有何感受
Actually i don't know how i feel about it

1534
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:32,000
只是我从一开始就对每个人来说并不是超级直观
It's just that this i wasn't super intuitive for everyone from the start

1535
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,230
这就像进入内部，呃，就像进入身体内部一样
And this like going inside it was , uh , like inside the body

1536
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,710
就像，你知道，真正关注事物
And like , you know , really paying attention to things

1537
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,950
我认为人们仍然习惯于，你知道，一旦像某些东西触发一样
I think people are still used that , you know , once like something triggers

1538
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,370
通常你把垫子收起来
Usually you put the pad away

1539
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,840
就像，你知道，游戏发生了
And just like , you know , the game happens

1540
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,490
白色上的一些东西
Whiting some things on p

1541
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,380
我们上演了他们
We staged them

1542
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,900
所以你必须移动相机
So you had to move the camera

1543
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,340
因为我们想吸引你
Because we wanted to engage you

1544
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:55,360
但后来我看到角色的电镀者刚刚走出画面
But then i watch the platers for characters just walk out of frame

1545
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,390
是的 。就这样，然后他们就开始说话了，你知道，就像在银幕外一样
Yeah . that's it then they talk , you know , from like offscreen

1546
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,190
我就像旋转相机
And i'm like rotate the camera

1547
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,145
请喜欢这显然只是为了 st
Please like it's obvious just for the st

1548
01:01:03,145 --> 01:01:05,030
但现在就这样结束了
But now it just finishes like this

1549
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:06,410
好吧
And well

1550
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:08,510
该，该，该，该
The , the , the , the

1551
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:10,710
这个设计的那些元素
The , the those elements of this design

1552
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,840
我，我，我真的，我真的很喜欢我们所做的事情
Which i , i , i really , i really like what we've done

1553
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,420
呃，乍一看并不明显，对吧
Uh , that are not obvious at the first glance , right

1554
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:16,940
例如
For example

1555
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,860
事实上，你实际上可以像以前一样在时间选择期间保持安静
The fact that you can actually stay quiet during time choices like did

1556
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,050
你知道吗
Did you know about that

1557
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,880
我的意思是，这实际上是我们支持moi的一个选择
I mean , it's an actually an option that we support moi

1558
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,080
每时每刻都在思考，对吗？
Think all all the time , like every time , right

1559
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:28,600
呃
Uh

1560
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,050
所以，但是人们，人们是，是
So , but but people , people are , are

1561
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,880
你知道，是由这样的想法触发的，嘿
You know , are are triggered by the idea that , hey

1562
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,200
我有时间真正下来
I have time actually going down

1563
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,560
所以我必须选择一些东西，对吧
So i have to pick something , right

1564
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,080
不，你是，你是演员
No , you are , you are the actor

1565
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,540
如果你不想说什么
If you don't want to say anything

1566
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,010
出色地
Well

1567
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,820
什么也别说。或者就像自我说的
Don't say anything . or like ego said

1568
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,680
如果你有这个，这个视图
If you have this , this view

1569
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,430
其实你可以四处看看，呃
You can actually well look around , uh

1570
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,750
就像莉兹凉亭里的自我一样
And like ego set in the lizz bower

1571
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:53,437
当你遇见朱迪，你就遇见了，呃，伊芙琳
When you meet judy and you meet , you meet , uh , evelyn

1572
01:01:53,437 --> 01:01:56,140
这是被设计成这样工作的东西
This is something that is designed to , to work like that

1573
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,540
所以你实际上可以看看，看看之前的每件事
So you can actually look at , look at every everything before

1574
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,120
而且，你知道，也许他们会做出反应
And , you know , maybe they will react

1575
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,520
也许不是
Maybe not

1576
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:07,742
但这实际上是我们有意识的设计和决定，为玩家提供这种
But it's actually conscious design and decision on our part to give the player this kind of

1577
01:02:07,742 --> 01:02:08,370
出色地
Well

1578
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:10,570
他们拥有的自由和他们必须做的自由
Freedom that they have that they have to

1579
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:16,520
或者至少不能以某种创造性的方式来增强玩游戏的整体体验
Or cannot at least use in some creative way to enhance the whole experience of playing the game

1580
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,540
因为到了游戏的最后，这就是游戏
Because at the very end of the game , this is a game

1581
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,140
所以没有过场动画
So there are no cutscenes

1582
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:23,470
有场景。场景是为了播放而制作的，嗯
There are scenes . and scenes are made to be played , um

1583
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:25,950
我想我们还是这样，呃
I think it's something we're still like , uh

1584
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,070
以某种方式学习
Learning in a way

1585
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:30,730
是你，抱歉，回到开头，就像，呃
It's the u , sorry , going back to the beginning of the start , like , uh

1586
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:34,190
我们在这场比赛中的所有比赛方式是，嗯
The way we approached through all playing in this game was , um

1587
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:38,090
也不仅仅是站在像，嗯
Was also not only on the side of like , um

1588
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,500
做出影响世界的重大选择
Making the big choices that affect the world

1589
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,700
就像，你知道的，把任务分成前面的过去等等
And like , you know , split the quest into the front past and so on

1590
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:47,020
但也有很多喜欢那些小的个人选择
But also plenty of like those small personal choices

1591
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:52,090
当你喜欢角色扮演角色时，它真的就像超级关键
When you like role playing the character without it's really being like super crucial

1592
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,450
就像你想如何表达自己一样
It's just like how you want to express yourself

1593
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,990
举例来说，所有那些你可以保持沉默的时间选择
So for example , all those time choices when you can stay silent

1594
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:01,090
你可以保持沉默。角色会对它做出反应，就像
You can stay silent . and characters will react to it like

1595
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:04,100
哦，例如，你不太爱说话
Oh you're not much of a talker , for example

1596
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,000
并且不需要分割任务
And it doesn't necessary split the quest

1597
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,660
但它让你对自己在这个世界上的身份有一点点不同的认识
But it gives you like a little bit of different flink of who you are in this world

1598
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,850
以及总是放弃游戏
As well as like always drop the game

1599
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,110
例如，您可以拒绝饮酒
You can refuse drinking , for example

1600
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:17,250
我认为是由其中一位qs提出的
something i think was proposed by one of the qs

1601
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,740
谁像直尺那样哈哈哈哈哈哈
Who's like a straight edge that ha ha ha ha ha ha

1602
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,280
其实喜欢有机会
Actually love to have a portunity

1603
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:22,560
是的
Yeah

1604
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,520
喜欢随时拒绝喝酒
To like to decline drinks at all times

1605
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,740
我们在整场比赛中都坚持这样做
And we went with it throughout the whole game

1606
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,980
你可以拒绝每次喝酒
You can decline drink every single time

1607
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,560
只是为了能够喜欢用这种，呃，用这种方式表达自己
Just to be able to like express yourself in this , uh , in this way

1608
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,770
所以不幸的是有很多非常小的选择
So there's a lot of really tiny choices that unfortunately

1609
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:39,650
我觉得他们并没有真正被视为选择
I feel they weren't really perceived as choices

1610
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:44,470
因为通常球员都会期望不同的工作人员会产生很多后果
Because usually players exuh expect a lot of consequences to different staff

1611
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,890
为什么我们创建这一层
Why we created this layer

1612
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:52,340
也就像，我知道喝醉了哈哈，就是这样，你是一个喝酒的角色
Also of just like , i know taking a rk ha ha that's it you're a drinking character

1613
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:52,640
是的
Yeah

1614
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,040
或者你可以真正专注于，你知道的，npc，嗯
Or you can just can be really focused on , you know , npc , um

1615
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,210
我认为我们仍在学习如何做得更好
And i think it's something we're still learning how to do it better

1616
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:00,880
呃
Uh

1617
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,860
比如说个人角色扮演层
How to like make this let's say personal role playing layer

1618
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:08,560
甚至对于玩家来说更酷
Even like cooler for the , for the player

1619
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,620
呃，为了让玩家能够享受到更多的乐趣
Uh , for the players to enjoy more

1620
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,300
一
Um

1621
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,390
但这是我们采用这种设计的第一款游戏
But it was our first game in this design

1622
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:17,150
所以我觉得一些错误肯定会发生
So like i feel some mistakes were bounds to happen

1623
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:18,890
或者就像上课一样
Or just like lessons

1624
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,290
我觉得这也许很有趣
I think it's interesting maybe

1625
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,032
呃，想想我们的例子
Uh , to think that in our case

1626
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:28,320
甚至诸如玩家的视线或玩家站立的位置之类的事情
Even things like where the player looks or where the player stands

1627
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,520
或者怎么样，多远还是多远
Or how , how far or how far

1628
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:35,830
他们与npc的接近程度也可以作为一个表达载体吧
How close they are to npc can also be used as an expression vectors , right

1629
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,370
作为可以定义他们关系的东西
As something that can define their relationship

1630
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,760
或者至少他们想如何接近这个人
Or at least how they want to approach this person

1631
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,920
所以当我们，你知道，设计整个系统时
So when we were , you know , designing the whole system

1632
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,200
那么几年前
So years ago

1633
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,730
我一直牢记着这样一个想法：你应该遇到一个实际上非常重要的人
I always had in mind this idea that you are supposed to meet someone that's actually very important

1634
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,050
我们被告知
And we are being told

1635
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,327
不要看着他们的眼睛
Do not look them in the eye

1636
01:04:54,327 --> 01:04:56,410
当然，你知道，你，你可以做到这一点
And of course , you know , you , you can do that

1637
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:59,610
事实上，你可以通过观察他们的另一只脚来环顾四周
You can actually look at their other feet to look look around them

1638
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:02,150
但我们实际上可以对玩家做出反应
But we can actually react to player

1639
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,910
直视他们的眼睛
looking straight in their eye

1640
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:07,830
并且实际上以支持该播放器的方式分支内容
And actually branch the content in a way that supports this player

1641
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:11,070
那其实是不想听游戏
That actually does not want to listen to the game

1642
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:15,140
即使不是，你知道，这不是选择集上的选择对了一半
Even though it's not , you know , it's not choice on that choice set choice half right

1643
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,520
这实际上不是你从列表中选择的东西
it's not something that you pick from a list is actually

1644
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:23,710
你在场景中的行为决定了世界对你的反应
How you behave inside the scene that defines the reactivity of the world towards you

1645
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,450
实际上再次让你融入游戏
And actually again grounds you in the game

1646
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,030
并让你再次成为
And allows you to be again

1647
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:31,080
场景内的演员
An actor inside the scene

1648
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,480
而且不仅仅是一个从中挑选的观察者，你知道
And not only an observer that picks from , you know

1649
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,480
绿色、红色、蓝色选择
Green , red , blue choices

1650
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,230
因为我们是，所以我们知道如何做到这一点
Because we are , we understand how to make this

1651
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:41,350
这是新的部分，实际上非常困难
This is the new part that actually extremely difficult

1652
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:43,107
但好吧
But well

1653
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:44,180
好玩吧
Fun , right

1654
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:44,680
凉爽的
Cool

1655
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,040
呃
Uh

1656
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,280
这正是我们在其他场合所看到的
This is exactly what we mon for other occasions

1657
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,880
就像餐厅旁边的这个jackie之类的
It's like this jackie by the restaurant and so on

1658
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:54,980
就像是你通过等待一段时间或朝某个特定方向看而做出的选择
Like it's the choices you make just by like waiting a little bit longer or looking in a particular direction

1659
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,540
或者进入某个特定的空间
Or entering a particular space

1660
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:59,150
这不是列出的选择之一
It's not one of those like listed choices

1661
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:00,290
人通常都是坚持不懈的
People usually persive

1662
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,090
哦，这个游戏没有选择
Oh , there are no choices in this game

1663
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,920
因为游戏就像往常一样会尽力做到这一点
because the game like usually it would try to make it

1664
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,160
所以它会以一种你看不到的方式调整你的行为
So it adjust to your behavior in a way that's certainly invisible for you

1665
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:08,600
也为了你
And for you

1666
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,020
就像是线性的
It's like it's linear

1667
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,540
就像，你知道，现在有一个问题
Like , you know , there are a tosis now

1668
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:12,900
其实如果你愿意的话，如果你和他一起去的话
Actually if you like , if you went with him

1669
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,480
你会有一个不同的分支
You would have a different branch

1670
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,350
你只是不太喜欢
You just didn't really like

1671
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:17,710
难道你不认为这是一个选择吗
Didn't you perceive it as a choice

1672
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:19,350
你只是以某种方式做到了
You just did it in a way

1673
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,262
正确的
Right

1674
01:06:20,262 --> 01:06:20,760
是的
Yeah

1675
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,390
我认为这就是我真正欣赏的事情
And i think that's like the thing that i really appreciate about

1676
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,570
对这个游戏很欣赏，也很欣赏
Appreciate about this game and appreciated it

1677
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:31,977
最喜欢玩的时间越长的就是像所有这些，所有这些你的样子
The most like the longer played is like all these , all these ways that you are

1678
01:06:31,977 --> 01:06:35,440
呃，影响v的体验
Uh , affecting the experience of v

1679
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,680
以及你的塑造方式
And how you're shaping

1680
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,760
你知道，这个故事以这些微妙的方式
You know , the story in these subtle ways

1681
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,570
就像你说的喝酒的事
The drinking thing like you mentioned

1682
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:42,290
我我喜欢那一刻
I , i like that moment

1683
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,640
我总是像
I always am like

1684
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,680
我想喝吗
Do i want to drink

1685
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,700
就像，就像提出这个选项让我进行自我反思
Like , like presenting that option makes me kind of self reflect

1686
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,640
所以这就像一种吸引玩家的方式
So it's like a way of almost like drawing the player in

1687
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,580
让他们思考正在发生的事情
And making them think about what's going on

1688
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:53,920
一
Um

1689
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,510
所以我们对着直边大喊
So we shout out to the straight edge

1690
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,200
一
Um

1691
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:56,750
但是是的
But yeah

1692
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,310
所以，当我们结束时
So , so as we're wrapping up

1693
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:01,810
我，你知道，我，我真的很喜欢看为什么要玩这个
And i , you know , i , i really love watching why play through this

1694
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:06,890
而且我确信玩游戏比呃，过场动画更有压力，嗯
And i'm sure it's more stressful to play through gameplay than uh , the cinematics , um

1695
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:09,390
但是，像这样结束
But to , to kind of wrap up like what

1696
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:12,690
对你们来说最大的收获是什么
What for you guys is like the biggest takeaway

1697
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:13,970
或者最大的收获之一
or one of the biggest takeaways

1698
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:17,150
你已经从这次经历中吸取了教训
You've had as far as like learning from this experience

1699
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:20,270
在未来的项目中你会随身携带的东西
Something that you're gonna take with you in future projects

1700
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:23,557
也许你，你不知道要进入这个
That maybe you , you didn't know going into this

1701
01:07:23,557 --> 01:07:26,160
显然，小伙子们学到了很多东西
Clearly there's guys learned a lot

1702
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,800
听起来好像发现了很多东西
It sounds like and discovered a lot of things

1703
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,260
但有一件事是什么呢
But what's one thing

1704
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,520
也许你会从中带走
Maybe that that you're gonna take away from this

1705
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,690
你有我有的东西
You have i have like semme something

1706
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,020
所以我，好吧
So i , okay

1707
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,810
所以，但你继续思考
So , but you keep thinking

1708
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,120
嗯，好吧
Um , all right

1709
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,917
所以，嗯
So , um

1710
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:41,470
好的
Okay

1711
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:41,670
它
It

1712
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:45,830
但这在某种程度上听起来可能很平庸，或者是非常明显的事情
But it , it may sound banal in a way or something that's like super obvious

1713
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,730
你知道，事后看来等等
You know , in hindsight and so on

1714
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:54,680
但是呃，所有场景的最佳效果是那些你喜欢投入情感的场景
But uh , the best effects for all the scenes are the ones you are like emotionally engaged in

1715
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,570
我知道这是一些超级
And i know it's some superva

1716
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:00,820
但是一旦你和npc建立了关系
But once you create the relationship with the npc

1717
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:04,722
而这个npc给人的感觉就是，呃，啊，人类
And this npc feels like , uh , ah human

1718
01:08:04,722 --> 01:08:09,560
这些就像游戏中所有最强大的时刻都像在那些个人路线上
These are like all the strongest moments in the game are like on those personal lines

1719
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,420
就像从我的角度来看，就像我有点喜欢这个情节一样
Like from my perspective , like i kind of like the plot

1720
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,720
超级复杂
It's super complicated

1721
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,100
呃
Uh

1722
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,980
我认为并且喜欢这很酷
I think and like it's cool

1723
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,540
你知道这是赛博朋克情节
You know it's the cyber punk plot

1724
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,680
还有那些最高的网络任务，一些东西
And those highest missions cyber something , something

1725
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,170
但所有最感动的时刻
But all the most touching moments

1726
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:28,210
我个人最喜欢这个游戏的所有东西都是个人的东西
And all the things i personally like most about this game is all the personal stuff

1727
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,170
就像巴拿马和咖喱一样
Like with with panam and curry

1728
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:34,170
所有与故事脱节的时刻等等
All the moments that are like mostly disconnected from the story and so on

1729
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:38,157
这是像你这样的人，不会碰你或喜欢你，呃
It's someone like you , no touching you or like , uh

1730
01:08:38,157 --> 01:08:41,060
接吻或只是坐在一起
Kissing or just like sitting next to each other

1731
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,080
壁炉旁边。等等
Next to the fireplace . and so on

1732
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,029
一切，一切都一样，嗯，随着这个身体的存在
All , all the like , um , with this body presence

1733
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:50,170
想想所有这些，比如与其他角色的接触和联系
Think all that like the touches and connection with other character

1734
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:51,870
当你把它放在画布上时
And also when you put it on the canvas

1735
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:56,350
有些人不喜欢赛博朋克，因为每个人都像，你知道的，在某种程度上孤独
Some dislike cyber punk quirt where everyone are like , you know , alone in a way

1736
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:59,149
和其他一切一样，距离遥远、风雨无阻
And like every other super distant and suding

1737
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:01,600
当一个喜欢的人真正关注你时
When someone like really pays attention to you

1738
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,060
就像你在他们眼中看到的那样
And like you see it in their eyes

1739
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,560
他们触碰你之类的东西
And they touch you and something

1740
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,340
它变得如此、如此神奇
It becomes something so , so magical

1741
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,460
所以对我来说
So for me

1742
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,279
我认为最大的收获就是永远不要
I think the biggest takeaway is to never

1743
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,490
曾经忘记过NPC和玩家之间的那些私人联系的时刻吗
Ever forget about those moments of personal connection between npc and player

1744
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,590
并不是像我和某人一起做很酷的事情
Not that just like i do cool stuff with someone

1745
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:22,151
有这样的阴谋，我们打倒这个组织
And there's this plot and we take down this organization is

1746
01:09:22,151 --> 01:09:23,960
为什么对我来说有意义
Why is it meaningful for me

1747
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,660
为什么对npc有意义
Why is it meaningful to npc

1748
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:26,819
NPC，相信我
The npc , trust me

1749
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:28,560
我不能让他失望。等等
I cannot let him down . and so on

1750
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,660
这是我要说的第一件事吗？
And is this first one thing i would say that would be my eoy

1751
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,620
我知道这可能是非常明显的
I know it's like maybe it's super obvious

1752
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,140
就像，嗯，事后看来
Like , um , in hindsight

1753
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,189
但这是，是的
But this is , yeah

1754
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:45,109
有时，最简单的回顾显而易见的事情是最重要的教训，很容易被忽视
Sometimes the simplest retrospect obvious things are the most important lessons that are easy to lose sight of

1755
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:47,532
所以我想，是的，这是一个很好的教训
So i think , yeah , that's a great lesson

1756
01:09:47,532 --> 01:09:48,768
一
Um

1757
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,350
我认为之后
I think that after

1758
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,569
你知道，在开发这个游戏这么多年之后
You know , after working on this game for so many years

1759
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:55,150
事实上在发布之后
And actually after releasing it

1760
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:58,277
有了这个之后，这次要真正反思一下了
And after having this , this time to actually reflect on it

1761
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:58,840
一
Um

1762
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,360
我明白这就是什么时候、什么时候
I understand that this is when , when

1763
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,285
当你真正从这个角度去制作游戏时
When you actually make a game from this perspective

1764
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:09,020
这与其他游戏并不是同一场比赛
It's not really the same race as , as do other games

1765
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:13,450
如果你明白我的意思的话，就像你一样，汽车和火车是不同的
If you know what i mean , like you like a car is a different than the train

1766
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,610
还有，还有，还有，你知道，还有
And , and , and , and you know , and

1767
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,190
还有、还有侧边自行车就在那里
And , and and side bicycle right there

1768
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:20,620
您可以在其中讲述精彩的故事
There are stories that you can tell great in the

1769
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,860
使用正常的古典叙事方式
Using the normal classical way of narration

1770
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,100
我认为有很多
And i think there are very

1771
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:29,870
非常有趣的故事，你只能使用第一人称或最好的故事
Very fun stories that you can only or best tale using this first person

1772
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:31,410
呃，叙述类型
Uh , type of narration

1773
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:35,600
我觉得你真的可以为两者制作同样的游戏
And i feel that you can really make the same game for , for both

1774
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,290
你知道，在这两种情况下事情的运作方式并不相同，呃
You know , like things don't work the same way in both cases , uh

1775
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:42,210
我们正在学习反方法来处理这种类型
And we are learning counter to approach this this type

1776
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:46,090
这很令人兴奋，因为这对我们来说是全新的领域
And it's exciting because it's completely new territory for us

1777
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:48,670
我也这么认为
It's something that i think that , well

1778
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:51,650
我们以前绝对不会这么做，这是肯定的，呃
We would never did before that's for sure , uh

1779
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:55,460
但我觉得里面的深度实在是太疯狂了
But i feel that there's just crazy amount of depth

1780
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,940
桌子上还剩下
Still left on the table

1781
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,920
以及我们可以接近的事情
And things that we can approach

1782
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,080
现在我们明白了，我们拥有所有的工具，对吗？
And we understand now that we , we have all the tools , right

1783
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,430
因为我们创造了设计
Because we created designs

1784
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,230
我们创造了工具
We created tools

1785
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:06,830
我们创造了处理事物的方法
We created approaches to things

1786
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:12,420
我们创建了整个疯狂的经验团队，他们是他们所做的事情中最好的，对吗？
We created whole insane experience team that is the best of what at what they do , right

1787
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,090
现在我觉得我们正处于做事的边缘
And right now i feel that we are at this very edge of doing

1788
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:19,580
你知道，这样做甚至可以做得更好
You know , doing even that doing stuff even better

1789
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:24,860
实际上，直接为这种特定类型的体验创建游戏
And actually creating a game straight up for , for this specific type of experience

1790
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:29,150
你知道，就像讲述一个只能以这种特定方式讲述的故事一样
You know , like for telling a story that can only be told in this specific way

1791
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:30,470
我认为这个独一无二
I think this unique

1792
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:33,970
我认为这对我作为一名设计师和创作者来说非常令人兴奋
I think this is very exciting for me as a designer , as a creator

1793
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:37,450
作为一个失去精彩内容的人
As a , as a person that los amazing content

1794
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:38,190
