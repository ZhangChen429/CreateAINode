00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,940
我们在设计中做的每一个决定，实际上都是为了支持这一点
And every decision we took in our design was actually to support that

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,370
我们希望能与我们度过美好时光

最终你会知道的

幕后一切的运作方式

我叫凯亚顿·卡普钦斯基

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,870
所以我们开始做基地

这次从赛博朋克到一千零七七，没错

你赐予好运

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,755
找熟啊

就是这样

我的时刻到了

我想让你和我一起走
I want you to walk with me

60
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,080
我想让你挥舞锤子
I'd like you to wield the hammer

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,290
把我钉在十字架上
Nail me to the cross

啊，谢谢你
ah thank you

65
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,710
呃，开始吧
uh , let's do this

66
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,550
你得说几句台词
You're gonna have to say some lines a few

67
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,820
那就把他们放到提词器上帮你
well put them up on the prompter for you

68
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,250
你不是救世主吗
are you not the messiah

69
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,020
救你自己，救救我们
save yourself and save us

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,550
你难道不敬畏上帝吗？
Do you not fear god

71
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,400
你同样被判同样的刑期
you stand condemned under the same sentence

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,780
在
Um

73
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,020
所以你们这些盘子是树的，呃
So those of you that plate which are tree , uh

74
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,200
我能看看是谁真的做的，或者宝宝进了烤箱吗？
Could i see who actually did or the baby into the oven

75
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:22,650
好
Okay

76
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,280
那真是很多。你怎么样，呃
That's that's a lot . how you , uh

77
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,135
谁在塞耶朋克里钉死了约书亚
Who did crucify joshua in sayer punk

78
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:28,670
好
Okay

79
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,190
我看到有些重叠
I see there's some overlap

80
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,050
呃，给我们
Uh , for us

81
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,610
提出这些问题非常重要
It's important to ask those questions

82
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,380
因为这些就是体验
Because those are the experiences

83
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,180
在我们的游戏中，玩家实际上可以选择合适的情境
The situations that player can actually go true in our game

84
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,000
我认为在讨论这种安排时，我们需要面对一些有趣的时刻和问题
I think there are just interesting moments and problems that we need to face when talking about this arration

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,500
我们也选择了这个
And we also chose this

86
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,220
这两点是有意为之，因为它们清楚地展示了不同的方法
those two things deliberately as they clearly showed the different approach

87
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,350
我们以赛博277英镑计入电影级设计
We took in terms of cinematic design in cyber pound two thousand and seventy seven

88
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,440
所以在今天的演讲中，我们将涵盖一些话题
So in today's talk , we will cover some topics

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,270
首先，什么是电影设计，以及我们的技艺到底是什么
First of all , what cinematic design is and actually what our craft is

90
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,700
我们如何想象玩家成为网络游戏场景中的演员。还有，呃
How we imagine players to become actors in the scenes of cyber pank . and , uh

91
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,440
我们如何构建设计设计叙事框架
How we build up a design design narrative frame

92
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,110
让我们能够真正拍摄那些场景
Allowed us to actually make those scenes

93
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,580
是的
Yeah

94
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,140
那么，先说起，呃
So to start with , uh

95
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,100
电影设计到底是什么鬼
What the hell is cinematic design

96
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,870
嗯，说实话，其实挺简单的
Um , honestly , it's pretty simple

97
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,210
呃
Uh

98
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,690
我们是负责创意设计的人
We are the people responsible for designing creative

99
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,600
在我们的游戏中创建互动内容
Creating interact , interactive content in our games

100
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,640
我们对它的外观负责，也要决定时机和节奏
We are responsible for how it looks and also the timing , the pacing

101
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,030
交付过程
The delivery of it

102
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,830
啊，所以我们专注于呈现场景
Ah , so we work on delivering scenes

103
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,090
就像第一个例子一样
like in the first example

104
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,510
我们用的是基于笔记的可视化脚本语言来处理
We use , we work on that using visual scripting language based on notes

105
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,310
就像第二部电影一样
Like in the second movie

106
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:40,740
也
Also

107
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,060
我们与演员合作，在 Mockup Stage 上完成任务
we work with actors on mockup stage to deliver

108
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,400
这些表演后来可以在我们的场景中使用
The performances that will later can use in our scenes that

109
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,920
我们希望玩家们真正体验到这些
We want the players to actually experience

110
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,710
嗯，在第一个例子中
Um , in the first example

111
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,190
所以就是《巫师》里的那种
So the one from the witcher

112
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,650
你可以看到一个很经典的，呃，电影式的旁白结构
You could see a pretty classic , uh , movie like narrational movie like structures

113
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,110
所以我们装了摄像头
So we had cameras

114
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,000
我们有剪辑，还有所有普通电影都有的元素
We had edit , and everything that normal movies also have

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,050
然而，除此之外，还有
However , in addition to all of that

116
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,730
我们确实有一些互动性
We do have some interactivity

117
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,940
互动性以选择的形式呈现给玩家
Interactivity presented in the form of choices that are presented to the player

118
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,560
无论他们是否真的把宝宝扔进烤箱
Whether they do throw the baby into the oven or not

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
呃，同时也在旁边
Uh , alongside with that

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,880
我们实际上可以用整个游戏过程中收集的一些变量来丰富内容
We actually can use some variables collected over the course of the whole game to branch the content deeper

121
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,720
对我们来说，重要的是，在这次演讲中值得一提的是，在那些场景中
What's important for us and worth mentioning during this presentation is that during those scenes

122
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,060
那些非常专注的特定时刻
Those very focused particular moments

123
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,430
整个游戏世界基本上都暂停了
The whole game world basically pauses

124
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,990
场景之外几乎没有发生什么
Nothing really is happening outside of the scenes

125
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,930
这些都很有针对性
Those are very directed

126
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,530
非常，嗯
Very , um

127
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,250
最好的戳，呃，解决方案
Very best poke , uh , solutions

128
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,870
以及，和，和，以及时刻
And , and , and , and moments

129
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,140
所以，呃，这是《猎魔人之树野外》中的一个场景示例
So , uh , this is an example of a one scene from the witcher tree wild

130
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,340
这实际上是一场舞台剧
And this actually is a stage play on

131
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,340
这里哪些Kittech，呃，在那个项目期间工作
Which kittech here , uh , work during that project

132
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,620
呃，你能看到的大多数节点
Uh , the majority of the nodes you can see here

133
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,580
呃，是我们所谓的分段
Uh , are what we call sections

134
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,300
各节包含了这些时间线中的时间线
Sections contain timeline in those timelines

135
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,060
我们实际上有动画和其他类型的事件来推动演员的表演
we actually have animations and other type of events that drive the performances of actors

136
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,010
以及我们希望在这些场景中发生的事情
And things that we want to happen during those scenes

137
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,850
呃，这里重要的是，整个体验非常有导向性
Uh , what's important to note here is that this whole experience is very directed

138
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,530
呃
Uh

139
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,630
这整个体验才是我们真正希望玩家体验的，对吧
This whole experience is what we actually want players to , uh , experience , right

140
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,090
呃
Uh

141
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,350
所以我们有选择可以分支联系内容
So we have choices that can branch the contact content

142
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,530
我们有变量
We have variables

143
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,730
但除此之外
But apart from that

144
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,730
场景中没有其他变化
Nothing else happens during the scenes

145
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,510
至于赛博朋克
As for cyber punk

146
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,020
从进球开始我们就知道，我们希望在训练上有所推进
We knew for from the get goal that we would like to push our discipline a little bit forward

147
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,030
我们也希望让玩家在场景中有更多角色扮演的机会
And we would like to give players more opportunities to role play during scenes

148
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,110
基本上是为了让他们在电影内容中有更多表达自己的方式
Basically to give them more ways to express themselves inside the cinematic content

149
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,120
所以我们想引导你了解我们的流程
So we'd like to guide you to our process

150
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,360
首先，我们必须问自己这个问题
First of all we had to ask ourselves this question

151
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,780
这是一个古老的问题，我们在GDC上也听过很多次
It's an ancient question we heard that many times even on gdc

152
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,060
啊，这也是我们自己问自己的问题
Ah it's also a question that we ask ourselves

153
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,480
当我们玩自己喜欢的游戏时
When we play the games we love

154
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,520
所以基本上，故事和赌博哪个更重要
So basically what is more important story or gambling

155
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,970
有人会说温和为王
some people would say that gentley is king

156
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,650
最重要的是玩游戏和游戏中的一切
As the most important thing is to play the game and everything else in the game

157
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,810
美学、艺术故事应被视为机制的仆人
Aesthetics , art story should be treated as servants towards the mechanics

158
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,310
这让游戏玩家能够体验
That allow game players to experience it

159
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,950
所以Cooker会同意这一点
So cooker would agree with that

160
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,360
我们有一些
We have some

161
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,570
好
Okay

162
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,170
鲍比，嗯，挺好
Bobby was , well , nice

163
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,400
所以别人会说这个故事才是王道
So h other people would claim that story is king

164
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,745
最重要的是故事，呃
That the most important thing is the story and , uh

165
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:34,790
我们希望玩家体验的冒险体验。以及后来
Adventure experience that we want players to go through . and later on

166
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,310
其他一切都应被视为对它的仆人
Everything else should be treated as servants towards it

167
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,070
所以机制、游戏等应被当作
So mechanics , gami and so on should be treated as

168
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,750
作为铺垫故事的东西
As something that builds up the story

169
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,340
他会同意谁
And who he would agree with that statement

170
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,377
好
Okay

171
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:50,210
你自豪地注意到，那个，呃，呃，十号赛跑了两次
You proudly notice that pao , uh , uh , race ten two times

172
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,130
其实这确实是件好事
And actually that's that's something

173
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,460
我们考虑的是白色产品，比如网络生产中的产品，因为 whera
We were thinking about white product like in production of cyber pbecause wheras

174
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,780
答案没那么简单
The answer is not that simple

175
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,760
因为这两点是游戏中非常重要的方面
Because those are two really important aspects of the game

176
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,780
即使我们是电影设计师
And even though we are cinematic designers

177
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,510
所以我们真正扎根于游戏的故事中，通过叙述
So we are really rooted in the story of the game in narration

178
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,940
我们认为两者都应同等重要
And we think that both are reas should be treated equal as equally important

179
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,742
我们应该想办法让这家公司变得真实
And we should find a way to make this corporation real

180
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:18,750
我们决定，作为设计师，我们的任务就是让它变得真实
And we decided that it's gonna be our task as designers to actually make it real

181
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,970
但游戏里说这个故事其实没什么意义
But saying that story in the game play doesn't mean much

182
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,250
但游戏设计方面
Yet for the game design

183
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,772
我们必须问问自己
We have to ask ourselves

184
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:27,140
如何赋予玩家这种感觉
How to give that to players

185
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,560
我们如何想象玩家及其在我们内容中的体验
How we imagine players and their experience inside our content

186
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,190
这就是为什么我们会问自己另一个问题
That's why we ask ourselves another question

187
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,010
什么，什么，什么，玩家是什么
What , what , what is the player

188
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,050
玩家在那段经历中的角色
Player role in that experience

189
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,770
因为我们天生就是电影设计师
As we are cinematic designers by heart

190
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,470
我们感觉自己有电影般的制作角色
We feeling of movie like production roles

191
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,110
首先，我们想到了电影导演
So first of all , we thought of movie director

192
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,110
一个控和控、指挥表演的人
A person who pushes and pull strings and directs the spectacle

193
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,510
这些事后可以被人民看到
that later on can be viewed by the people

194
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,582
他们要么坐在沙发上，要么在电影院里，对吧
They on the couch or on the cinema , right

195
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:57,480
我们会想到演员
We think of actors

196
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,940
那些在内心激发情感的人
People who invoke emotions internally

197
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,440
他们自己经历过这个剧本
Who experience , uh , this screen play on their own

198
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,940
后来观众也能对他们产生共鸣
And later on viewers can empathize with them

199
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,440
观众可以和演员一起缓解情绪
The viewers can relieve the emotions together with the actors

200
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,400
在游戏中，比如那些免费的
In the game like which are free

201
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,380
我们会说玩家喜欢过场动画
We would say that players like in terms of cinematics

202
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,920
玩家更像是导演
Players are more of the directors

203
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,110
他们会不时挑选一些选项，看看表演如何
They choose , uh , some options from time to time to see how the spectacle

204
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,305
当他们做出这个决定时，剧情会如何展开
How the show will unfold when they make that decision

205
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:28,370
然而，对于赛博朋克来说
However , for cyber punk

206
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,870
我们决定想要，呃
We decided that we would like to , uh

207
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,680
稍微转动一下，让玩家扮演角色，扮演角色
Turn a little bit and give the players role of actors of people

208
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,280
前排座位上的人
Who are there in the front seat

209
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,365
并且可以体验所有正在发生的事情，并在我们为他们准备的舞台上表演
And can experience everything that's happening and perform on a stage that we prepare for them

210
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:43,740
呃，再来一次
Uh , so again

211
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,740
表面上看这其实非常简单，对吧
This is something extremely simple on the surface , right

212
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,700
但无论如何，我们到底该如何做到这一点
But however , how , how do we actually do that

213
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,640
我们如何在这些场景中创造演员和演员
How do we make players and actors inside those scenes

214
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,360
确实
For sure

215
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,500
其中一部分就是沉浸感
One part of it that that is immersion

216
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,620
沉浸感是一个巨大的世界
Immersion is this big gigant world

217
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,565
但对我们来说，基本上意味着
But for us , it basically means

218
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:01,040
我们可以拥有产品
We can have the product

219
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,080
场景非常沉浸
The scenes being very immersive

220
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,920
如果我们真的允许玩家参与其中
If we actually allow the player to take part in them

221
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,170
如果我们能真正在最基本的层面上与他们互动
If we can actually actually engage them on a very basic level

222
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,860
对我们来说
For us

223
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,560
这是关键且关键的
This is something crucial that's the in

224
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,140
这正是设计的核心
And that the heart of the design

225
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,060
呃，就是能够真正影响场景，成为那些场景中的演员
Uh , the ability to actually influence the scenes to be an actor inside those scenes

226
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,550
在
Um

227
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,260
对我们来说，如果我们做好工作，也很重要
And for us , it also if we do our job well

228
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,420
这也会减少游戏中叙述部分之间非常自然的摩擦
It will also reduce the very natural friction between the narration part of the game

229
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,340
还有游戏的玩法部分
And the gameplay part of the game

230
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,820
再
Again

231
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,880
如果我们愿意，这一点很重要
This is important if we want to

232
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,900
呃，提供我们想要的体验
Uh , deliver the experience that we want to deliver

233
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,850
不过，我们很快发现，呃，它是
However , we quickly discovered , uh , that it's

234
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,210
井
Well

235
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,690
如果你的产品有非常沉浸式的体验
If you have a very immersive quieis in your product

236
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,610
而且这次是内幕
And in this case inside scenes

237
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,030
精彩的场景只能越来越精彩
Well , amazing scenes get only better

238
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,630
因为沉浸感，对吧
Because of the immersion , right

239
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:54,600
不过，场景中某些部分的瑕疵通常会被摄像头遮盖
However , some parts of the scene on the imperfections that you would normally hide under the camera

240
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,550
猫或剪辑基本上都很突出
Cats or editing basically stick out

241
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,940
因为，沉浸感会让一切更加丰富
Because , well , immersion multiplies everything

242
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,960
在这种情况下，我们必须时刻牢记
And in this case , we had to always keep in mind that

243
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,130
内容丰富
There is a good content

244
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,770
还有更糟的内容，我们真的需要，呃
There is worse content , and we need to actually , uh

245
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,570
要非常小心这两者
Be very wary of the of , of both

246
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:18,640
我们让演员和演员进入场景的另一个方法是我们称之为“层面叙事”
Another part of our approach to making players and actors in the scene is what we call the diatic narration

247
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,220
所以，呃，关于我们是否真的实现这种自由
So , uh , the part about if we actually deliver this kind of freedom

248
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,390
这种在场景中的投入，是为了让演员们受益
This kind of engagement inside the scenes towards to , to do the players well

249
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,510
他们需要理解游戏规则
They need to understand the rules of the game

250
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,130
他们每年都需要明白这一点
They need to understand that every year

251
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,470
在那些场景中，对他们施加的限制是可以理解的
A limitation that actually is put on them during those scene is understandable

252
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,400
这就是限制的理由
That the justification for the limitation

253
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,830
这种约束其实是可以理解的
The constraints is actually understandable

254
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:47,010
他们知道角色和演员在那些场景中发生了什么
And they know what's happening to their characters , to their actors inside those scenes

255
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,070
嗯，玩家应该始终被控制
Um , player should be controlled at all times

256
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,690
这就是，这就是我想读这句话
This is this , this i wanted to read this sentence

257
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,250
因为这极其重要
Because this is extremely important

258
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,137
同样，这也是我们设计的核心
And again , at heart of our design

259
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,020
呃，第三件事我们知道
Uh , third thing that we knew

260
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,640
我们基本上不得不放弃，呃，从那里
We had to basically abandon , uh , from

261
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,400
这就是后世界的概念
Which was the post world concept

262
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,680
所以每当场景真正发生时
So whenever scene was actually happening

263
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,740
我们已经无法基本上说
We no longer could basically say

264
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,120
好
Okay

265
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,820
除了这些场景之外，什么都没发生
Nothing else happens beside the scenes

266
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,392
不
No

267
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,490
我们如果真的要
We if in order to actually

268
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,790
你知道的，实际上是
Uit be to , you know , to actually

269
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,320
还有，赋予玩家影响那些场景的能力
And ah , give the player ability to influence those scenes

270
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,740
并且能够在那些场景中做出动作
And be able to do actions during those scenes

271
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,780
无论是通过叙事驱动的行动还是通过游戏玩法，基本上都必须说明
Whether by narrative driven actions or by gameplay needed to basically say

272
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,240
好
Okay

273
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,220
从现在起，每个场景都是实时的
Every scene is real time from now on

274
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,180
在这个例子中，你可以看到我们实际上正和Jackie对话
So in this example , you can see that we are actually in the middle of conversation with jackie

275
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,020
然而，在背景中
However , in the background

276
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,640
世界只是流动着
The world simply flows

277
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,980
世界就是这样发生的
The world simply happens

278
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,380
也许我们身边就有一场戏
Maybe there is a scene happening right next to us

279
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,290
而且实际上，呃，内容并没有什么分开
And nothing actually , uh , is separating as from the content

280
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,370
游戏中的旁白
The narration from the gameplay in this

281
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,950
在 中 ，在此具体例子中 
In , in this , in this specific example

282
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,130
所以我们必须思考表演到底是什么
So we had to think about what acting really is

283
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,400
我们的经历是从MOCUP阶段开始的
And we came to our experiences from mocup stage

284
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,540
所以基本上，我们在处理因素时使用的规则之一是行动
So basically one of the rules that we use while working with factors is acting

285
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,880
他做了，呃，这还不够
He's doing so , uh , it's not enough

286
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,720
如果因子只是显示在屏幕上
If factor is just sat on the screen

287
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,660
演员不得不哭出来才能向观众展示这一点
Actor has to burst into tears to show that to the viewers

288
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,757
而且，呃，考虑到这一点
And , uh , having that in mind

289
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:11,290
我们知道需要提升场景的互动性
We knew that we need to boost interactivity of our scenes

290
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,890
让玩家在这些场景中拥有更多动作动词，以便执行
To give players more action verbs inside those scenes to be able to perform

291
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,470
第一动作动词 ，我们从之前的标题中非常熟悉
And first action verb the , the one that we know well from our previous titles

292
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,690
看看它说话的能力
See its ability to talk

293
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,290
基本上就是能够对其他角色发声
So basically being able to speak up to other characters

294
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,340
能够准确选择角色说什么，呃
Being able to choose what your character will say exactly , uh

295
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,890
有时甚至会为每个角色选择我们想说的话
And sometimes even choosing to each character we want to speak

296
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,450
我们在游戏中有两种选择，帮助
We have two types of options in our choice helps in the game

297
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,440
我们可以在上面的例子中看到这一点
We can see that in the upper example

298
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,810
呃，蓝色的那是毛茸茸的
Uh , blue ones are fluffs

299
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,910
这些是能让你更了解NPC世界背景的
Those are the ones that give you more context of the world of the npcs

300
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,790
并能引导你找到更多内容
and can lead you to additional content

301
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,437
如果你愿意投资这方面
If you want to invest into that

302
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:53,280
呃，黄色的那个是重点——那些是你可以挑选新花纹的
Uh , yellow ones are emphasithose are the ones that you can pick on new ones

303
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,040
而且，呃，当你做的时候
And , uh , well when you do it

304
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,495
故事将朝着新的方向展开
The story will unfold in new direction

305
00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:59,340
对我们来说，赛博朋克的新事物
What is new for us in cyber punk

306
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,260
你可以在第二个例子中看到，我们，呃
And that is something you can see in the second example is that we , uh

307
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,400
玩家也可以用沉默作为动作变化
Used silence as an action vary for players as well

308
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,460
我们以前从没这样过
We never did that before

309
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,780
但是你
But u

310
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,930
在这个例子里
Well in this example

311
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,570
你可以看到
you can see that there is a situation in

312
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:17,110
如果玩家在这个例子中不主动对克莱尔说话的话
Which if player don't speak up to claire at in this exact this example

313
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,030
她会在那里杀了Samsonuh，因为我们没有采取任何行动
She will kill samsonuh there because we didn't take , take any action on that

314
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,280
所以我们想在叙事层面上真正使用另一个动作
so another , uh , action that we wanted to actually use in a narrative sense to give

315
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,700
作为玩家表达的载体，是能够移动极其基础的东西
And use as an expression vector for the player was dability to move something extremely basic

316
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,740
仔细想想，对吧
When you think about it , right

317
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,840
那么，在哪棵树下
So in which tree

318
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,320
我们基本上只会在对话作中选择UI内容
We will basically limiting ourselves to only the talk action to picking stuff from the ui here

319
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,410
我们实际上想使用非常自然的游戏元素
We actually want to use very natural elements of gameplay

320
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,790
在这种情况下，移动
In this case movement

321
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,010
呃，上面的例子
Uh , on the top example

322
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,330
你可以看到某人实际上
You can see that someone as actually

323
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,880
玩家移动得太靠近另一个角色
The player moved too close to another character

324
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,260
他们把这些人推开了
And they pushed them away

325
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,520
这对我们来说非常重要
This was important for us

326
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,760
这一举措是对此的反应
This action in reaction

327
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,080
呃，类似的
Uh , type of thing

328
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,220
嗯，另一方面
Um , on the other hand

329
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,780
我们也可以看到 ，例如
We could also see that , for example

330
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,060
第二个例子
In the second example

331
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,600
对不起。第二个例子
I'm sorry . in the second example

332
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,000
基本上，玩家是在被教导
Basically , player was being taught

333
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,030
别往我这边走一步
Do not take one step towards me

334
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,280
否则我会自杀
Or i will kill myself

335
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,140
而这个角色正是这么做的
And the character did exactly that

336
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,980
所以，能够实际解读距离某物的能力
So the ability to actually interpret the distance towards something

337
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,420
解读它的能力
The ability to interpret it

338
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,089
如果玩家角色真的在某个区域
If player character is actually somewhere in an area

339
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,430
你知道，他们要么进去了，要么实际上，呃，离开了
You know , they , either they entered it or actually , uh , left it

340
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,099
呃，对我们来说，这非常有用
Uh , for us , it was extremely useful

341
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,150
呃，作为叙事工具
Uh , as a narrative tool

342
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,070
所以整体上，球员位置确实很有特色
So the player position in general was something

343
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,697
我们可以从叙事角度解读
We could interpret in a narrative sense

344
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:34,780
还有一个简单的动作
And another simple action

345
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:40,120
动作动词，我们可以解读它环顾四周的能力，它存在于每个可能的游戏中
Action verb that we can interpret it's ability to look around it's there in every game possible

346
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,180
但我们在电影设计中使用它，实际上推动了场景的发展
But we use it in our cinematic design to actually drive the scenes forward

347
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,590
我们能够检查玩家是否会看某样东西
And we were able to check whether players look at something

348
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,490
或者说，他们会多久不看
Or maybe not look at it for how long do they look at it

349
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,660
如果它在他们的屏幕空间里。诸如此类
If it's in their screen space . and so on

350
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,540
呃，你可以在这个例子中看到这一点
Uh , you can see that in this example

351
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,240
现在有一个场景，店主让玩家看向摄像机
Now there is a scene in which shopkeeper asks player to look into the camera

352
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,020
而且这以前是我们没做过的
And the like that's something we didn't do previously

353
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,700
但此时我们只用这个动作
But at this time we just use this action

354
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,970
玩家的动词必须看向摄像头，混蛋
Verbs of player has to look into the camera asshole

355
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,660
它可以进行一些扫描
It can perform some scanning

356
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,727
这样故事就能推进工作
And that will let the story progress for work

357
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:11,610
另一个动作动词
Another action verb that we

358
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,630
呃，我想用的是行动能力
Uh , would like to use is the ability to act

359
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,390
按法案划分
By act

360
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,192
我是说，嗯
I mean , um

361
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:21,260
做一些叙事动作，实际上是，呃，定制的
Do some narrative action that's actually , uh , custom

362
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,720
所以在这个例子中，呃
So in this example , uh

363
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,100
我们被背叛了
We were betrayed by proceed

364
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,130
我们醒来时发现他
We woke up to him

365
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,740
我们只是被提示要揍他一拳
We are just , we are presented with an option to punch him

366
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,460
而我们正是为自己做到这一点
And we do exactly that for us

367
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,380
这很重要，因为它让我们能够实现那些自定义的互动
It was important because it gave us the ability to have those custom interactions that are

368
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,950
这些在叙事意义上是有意义的，对吧
That are meaningful in the narrative sense , right

369
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,840
例如，这里我们可以超越某人
So , for example here we can pass someone

370
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,500
但如果你真的能倾身去亲吻某人呢
But what if you could actually lean towards someone and kiss them

371
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,480
或者干脆抱抱他们
Or simply but or simply hug them

372
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,560
这些都是重要的叙事行动，我们可以简单地采取并运用
Those are all important narrative actions that we can simply take and use

373
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,130
呃
Uh

374
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,540
我们用的是界面
We used the ui

375
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,620
其实我们已经在用来做，呃，对话选项了
We actually we're already using for the , uh , dialogue choices

376
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,400
不过，我们通过行动税和图标来扩展了它
However , we expanded it by in action tax and icons by action tax

377
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
我是说简短的描述，告诉你
I mean quick descriptions that tell you

378
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
玩家到底会怎么做
What will exactly happen for the to the player

379
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,420
当那个选项被选中时，实际上就是为我们选好了
When that pick that option is actually picked for us

380
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,330
再次强调，所有事情都非常重要
It was extremely again important to make all

381
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:15,050
玩家角色在每个关卡结束时发生的所有事情都很容易理解
What's all all things happening to the player character understandable on ending every level

382
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:20,130
所以我们非常明确地说明这些行为的后果
So being very explicit about the consequences of the actions were for us

383
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,137
对我们来说非常重要
Was for us very important

384
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:26,200
另一部分是我们实际上能做的事情的巨大容器
Another part of this is this gigantic container of things that we actually can do

385
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,130
所以动作动词 do，呃
So action verb do , uh

386
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,570
这是一个包含所有游戏内容的容器
This is a container for all the gameplay stuff

387
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,030
无论是射击、驾驶还是跳跃
So whether it's shooting , driving on jumping

388
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,240
我们可以用这个作为叙事上的表达向量，给玩家
We can use this narratively as an expression vector for the player

389
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,410
我们实际上可以把他们的行为解读为场景中可用的素材
And we can actually interpret their actions as something we can use inside the scenes

390
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,020
这里。我们可以看到玩家基本上被要求说
Here . we can see that player is being asked to basically say

391
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,020
亚当斯马舍游戏Boss会发生什么
What will happen with adamsmasher game boss

392
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,690
呃
Uh

393
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,010
我们可以在某种正弦波的催化转换器上做这件事
We could do this on a cat sine of some sort

394
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,690
我们的生活
Howare for us

395
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,890
让这个个人时刻留给玩家非常重要
It was important to have this personal moment be left the player

396
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,820
所以他们可以直接走开，什么都不做，把他留在这种状态
So they can simply walk away and do nothing and leave him in this state

397
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,530
或者他们可以当场开枪
Or they can simply shoot him right there

398
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,315
我们也会在叙事层面支持这一点
And we also will support this on the narrative side

399
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:11,470
现在我们可以看一个短场景，这段戏能展示
And now we can watch a short scene that kind of shows

400
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,110
一切美好在动态中如何运作
How it all good works in motion

401
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,870
这是你所举的例子之一
It's one of the examples you

402
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:20,350
你可以看到，在《Cyberpanel》的每个场景中，几乎都有不同的动作动词
You can see that basically in every scene in cyberpanel there's those different action verbs

403
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,210
没关系，让开
That's fine step aside

404
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,020
你怎么知道该怎么办
what got any idea what to do

405
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,560
我打算绕过耦合线，安装一个热线压缩机
I'm gonna bypass the couple line and rig a hot wire compressor

406
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,080
一直跑下去可能会卡住
run on and on could seize up

407
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,060
有人问过你的看法吗？
did anyone ask you your opinion

408
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,960
好，看看会发生什么
okay let's see what happens

409
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,480
就像我跟你说的
it's like i was telling you

410
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,520
在
u

411
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,760
一点也不差
Not shabby at all

412
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,930
关于它能用多久的问题
Questions how long it will last you

413
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,780
今晚我会想出别的办法，对吧
it'll give me tonight city i'll figure something else out there right

414
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,200
所以我们知道，表演就是
So we know that acting is doing

415
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,340
但表演也是反应，呃
But acting is also reacting that's also , uh

416
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,140
我们的规则是，在与演员合作时，会有更多风险
The rule for us , while we work with actors some more up stakes

417
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,300
所以每当演员执行某个动作时
So whenever actors perform perform some action

418
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,900
他们可以预期其他行为者会对此做出反应
They can expect other actors to react to it

419
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,530
这就创造了那种美妙的张力
And that creates that beautiful tension

420
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,310
通常最好的表演往往来自其中
And usually the best performances comes out of it

421
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,300
那是。为什么要在我们的电影设计中
That's . why in our cinematic design

422
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,660
我们不仅想有互动性
We wanted to not only have interactivity

423
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:44,300
我们用这个术语指的是向玩家展示的明确动作，作为前进选项
Which we use this term for the explicit action that we show to the player as an option to move forward

424
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,440
但我们也想有一些反应
But we also wanted to have some reactivities

425
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,560
基本上就是要识别玩家在做什么
So basically recognize what player is doing

426
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,150
也许还能做点什么
And maybe do something with it

427
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,150
举个例子
And to show you one example

428
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,530
有一个场景玩家可以和Kerg结束对话
There is a scene in which player can wrap up conversation with kerg

429
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,990
坐在桌子旁的那个人
The guy sitting by the table

430
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,500
呃
Uh

431
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,360
然而，如果就在此刻
However , if at this exact moment

432
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,860
玩家会看向网站，看大乔
Player will look to the site , to the big joe

433
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,940
他们只是坐在那里
Who were just sitting there

434
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,410
但她挺身而出，呃
But stood up to , uh

435
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,690
给玩家让路，呃
Make way for the player , uh

436
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,910
这个大个子会用枪冲刺动画
This big fellow will play a rushing animation with his gun

437
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,160
只是为了让玩家站起来
Just to wash the player to stand up

438
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,920
而且更多玩家还能用嘲讽的台词回应这份大任务
And even more player will be then able to react to that with some mocking line for the big job

439
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,800
所以我们试图承认行动
So it's a situation in which we try to acknowledge action

440
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,490
玩家在场景中使用的动词
Verbs that player uses in the same in the scene

441
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,950
我们也试图通过内心鼓励来推广它
And we try to promote it with some in inward encouragements

442
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,410
比如说，这里
Let's say so , for example , here

443
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,890
你能感受到你们之间的紧张气氛
You could feel the tension between you

444
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,090
从场景一开始就要感谢大乔
And big joe for this from the start of the scene

445
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,840
如果你跟随这种张力
And if you follow that tension

446
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,560
那你可能会有点重战
Then you might get some rewar

447
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,320
而奖励就是最后的话
And the reward is the last word

448
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,660
所以我们会给玩家一些动画或主要是线条的选择作为奖励，供玩家探索
So we give some animation or mainly lined to pick from as a reward for players to explore

449
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,940
然而，我们觉得我们只是触及了这个话题的表面
However , we feel that we only scratch the surface of this topic

450
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,120
我们发现，这种积累真的很好
and we found that it's really good to build up

451
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,320
更像是作为演员身临其境的感觉
Even more of a feeling of being there as an actor

452
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,380
当NPC和世界对你的行为做出反应时
When npc and world react to your actions

453
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,292
而这些并不是主要的路径
Which are not exactly the main path

454
00:22:59,292 --> 00:22:59,950
呃
Uh

455
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,600
接下来我们想谈的是
So the next part we would like to talk about is

456
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,380
井
Well

457
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,770
我们之前谈过的所有事情
Everything we talked up about up until this point

458
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,630
可能用第三人称视角，期待动图
Could be potentially used in a third person expecting gif

459
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,740
这会很简单
It would simply work

460
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,140
不过，我们决定用第一人称视角
However , we decided about on , on first person perspective

461
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,660
这也带来了我们真正能够利用的独特挑战和机遇
And with that comes unique challenges and opportunities that we can actually use

462
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,210
我们需要考虑，呃
And we need to think about , uh

463
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,810
所以在《西伯朋克277》中没有CS罪
So no cs sins in the , in siberpunk twenty seventy seven

464
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,070
我们基本上没有猫的情景，呃
We basically have no cat ines , uh

465
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,920
这是我们在三十八年后做出的艺术决定，嗯
It was an artistic decision made by us after e three eighteen basically , um

466
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,930
看了一下游戏剧情
Took a look at the game story

467
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,060
所以故事讲述了V在黑暗未来之城中的雇佣兵
So the story about v a mercenary in a city of dark future

468
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,450
这也关乎故事
It's also about story

469
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,670
这也是一个关于VIP的故事
It's also it's also a story about vip

470
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,880
因为她快死了，两个人格在她脑海中冲突
Because she is dying , a two personalities clash in her head

471
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,800
而我们作为玩家需要做出决定
And we as a player need to decide

472
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,142
他们到底会发生什么，呃
What would actually happen , uh , to them

473
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:51,710
呃，对我们来说，那是非常私密的个人故事
Uh , for us it was extremely intimate personal story

474
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,730
你只是感受到这种特定的观点
And you simply felt that this particular viewpoint

475
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,610
所以这是玩家的视角
So point of view of the player

476
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:01,262
这本身就是这个故事的骨头
Itself is the bone to pick for this specific story

477
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:04,240
这并不意味着游戏中我们实际上没有猫
That does not mean we actually don't have cats during the game

478
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,120
因为我们在画面编辑中使用的猫在画面中
Because we use , uh , in a frame cats we use in frame editing

479
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,240
我们用montouches，呃，唯一完全例外的规则
We use montouches , uh , the only exact , exact exception to this rule

480
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,830
我们的游戏结局
Our game endings

481
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,710
我们基本上想向玩家展示他们完整立体的角色
we basically wanted to present to the player their fully realized character

482
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,340
因为他们经历了一段故事
Because they went through a story

483
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,780
而且在最后
And at the very end of it

484
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,100
他们可以看看自己的角色，然后说
They can take a look at their character and say

485
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,380
哦，好像这就是我
Oh , like this is me

486
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,420
这些是我的选择
Those are my choices

487
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,860
我也明白了我到底是怎么做到的
And i understand how did i actually

488
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,380
呃，是为我们而来的
Uh , got here for us

489
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,060
对于第一人称来说，这是显而易见的选择
It was an obvious choice when it comes to the first person

490
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,940
还有，呃，啊，最后是卡斯廷斯
And , uh , ah , castines at the end

491
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,420
我们感觉非常合适
We feel just fit perfectly

492
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,890
第一个人视角游戏的一个重要方面是身体呈现
Big aspect of first personal perspective games is body presents

493
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,290
在我们的游戏里
And in our game

494
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,890
我们决定尸体将始终在场
We decided that body will be present at all times

495
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,600
所以每当玩家低头看摄像头时
So whenever players look down with their camera

496
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,630
他们会看到自己的躯干和腿部
They will see their torso and legs

497
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,700
我们也可以用它来做叙事
We could use that narratively as well

498
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,550
因为我们可以在场景中准备很多自定义姿势
Because we could prepare a lot of custom poses in scenes

499
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,280
还有，呃，表演演员
And , uh , show players

500
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:05,585
在场景中，艺术家们又多了一层情感、紧张和意图，呃，场景本身
Another layer of emotions and tension and intention of asas artists in the scene , uh , itself

501
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:07,540
我们摆出姿势
We be besides poses

502
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,800
我们尝试了球员手势的概念
We played with the idea of player gestures

503
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,190
所以每当玩家发声时
So whenever player speaks out

504
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,160
我们有时会在那个动作上再演奏
We sometimes played the gesture on top of that

505
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,630
你可以在下面那个关于taka oranine diner的例子中看到这一点
You can see that in the lower example with taka oranine diner

506
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,670
呃，实际上我们的结果是参差不齐的
Uh , that we had mixed result with that actually

507
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,920
我们发现，它在意图之后触发时效果最好
What we found out that the it did work best when it's trigger just after the intention

508
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,160
刚选好选项
Just after picking the option

509
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,070
所以玩家觉得这是，呃
So player feels it's a connection between , uh

510
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,890
然后是场景中的玩家和玩家角色
and then player and the player character in the scene

511
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,852
上
On

512
00:25:33,852 --> 00:25:34,900
哦，抱歉
Oh sorry

513
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,390
抱歉，我漏掉了一个
Sorry , i skip one

514
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,940
好
Okay

515
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,900
除了姿势和手势之外
So on top of poses and gestures

516
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,890
我们加了点东西，呃
We added something , uh

517
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,910
可以说是微妙的，但对我们来说非常重要
Let's say subtle , but really important to us

518
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,030
所以我们有一个摄像头平行
So we have a camera parallets

519
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,710
基本上，每当玩家用摄像机环顾四周时
So basically , whenever players look around with their camera

520
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,310
它不仅仅是作为空间中的固定点旋转
It doesn't only rotate as a fixed point in the space

521
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,450
但它确实会动
But it actually moves

522
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,250
呃，是定制的曲线，模拟转动头部的感觉
Uh , on a custom curve to imitate the feeling of moving your head around

523
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,460
因此，我们得到了这个很酷的结果
So thanks to that , we have this cool result

524
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,640
不同物体对不同大脑的酷炫影响
A cool effect of different objects on different brains

525
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,800
画面中的平面
Planes in frame

526
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,380
创作立场的转变
Changing creative positions

527
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,990
正因为如此，整个场景感觉更扎实
And thanks to that , it all feels , feels more grounded in the scene

528
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,350
我们还会在角色上方播放呼吸动画
We also play breathing animations on top of the character

529
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,050
这样你才能感受到身体的生命
So you can feel your body is alive

530
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,065
我们也可以用这种方式来叙事
And we can use that narratively as well

531
00:26:14,065 --> 00:26:16,270
呃，无论我们什么时候寻找或累了
Uh , whenever we seek or tired

532
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,700
我们可以增强动画效果，带来更多
We can boost the animation to give a more

533
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,310
更像是一种情感的感觉
More of a feeling of emotion

534
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,710
致玩家的意图
Intention to the players

535
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,760
而且，呃，我们的角色是全程配音的
And , uh , our character is fully voiced

536
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,600
如果你考虑虚拟对手游戏，这并不是一个显而易见的选择
That's not an obvious choice if you think about vp games

537
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,650
但我们追求的是最大的沉浸感和故事驱动的游戏
But we strive for the biggest immersion and story driven game in a way

538
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,930
我们觉得这是显而易见的选择
And we thought that's an obvious choice for us

539
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,300
我们还玩了各种声音
We also played with the sounds

540
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,220
所以我们希望声音是可听见的
So we want it to be audible

541
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,700
就像你自己的耳朵一样
as it would be with your own ears

542
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,750
当你和身体一起出现在场景中时
When you are there in the scene with your body

543
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,370
啊，最后的粉色是镜子
Ah , the last pink are mirrors

544
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,110
这对我们来说非常重要
And that's really important for us

545
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,810
因为我们知道赛博裤的个性和风格很重要
Because we know character and style is important for cyberpants

546
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,140
尤其是我们有角色自定义和许多非常棒的服装
Especially that we have character customization and lots of really amazing clothes

547
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,190
我们想让事情变得有点道理
And we wanted to have some sense in

548
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,780
我们可以建立玩家与可控角色之间的联系
Which we can build up the connection between player and playable character

549
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,270
呃，虽然我们决定不看过场动画
Uh , even though we decided not to look cut scenes

550
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,690
我们想展示这一点
We wanted to show this

551
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,550
所以即使每次游戏开始时，基本上都是用镜子看到的
So even started game with every , every start of the game is basically seen with the mirror

552
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,000
世界玩家的另一面
Another part of world players

553
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,232
演员第一人称视角
An actor first person perspective

554
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:19,650
机遇与挑战是框架塑造
Opportunities and challenges is framing

555
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,070
呃
Uh

556
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,350
因为像接受，呃
Because like kaccept , uh

557
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,410
框架来自球员的身体
Framing comes from player's body

558
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,670
呃，这基本上是我们理所当然的事情
Uh , it's something that we basically take as a granted

559
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,090
我们不能自己移动摄像机
We can't move the camera on its own right

560
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,090
某种程度上
In a way

561
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:34,030
在这里，玩家比我们更像摄影师
Gamers in this case are more cinematographers than than we are

562
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,620
因为他们决定呈现的框架
Because they decide on the frame that's presented

563
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,310
在
Um

564
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:42,070
我们很快注意到镜头的构图其实非常集中
And we quickly noticed that the framing of the shots is actually very centric

565
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,850
所以我们有意识地使用它
So we use that consciously

566
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,800
因为玩家想真正看到屏幕中央的角色
Because players wanted to actually see the characters in the center of their screens

567
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,595
所以这实际上是我们在工作中必须考虑的事情
So this is something we actually have to take into account during , uh , our work

568
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:55,980
另一部分原因是，我们，嗯
Another part of that is that we , well

569
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,810
我们实际上调整镜头的机会有限
We had limited opportunities to actually tweak the shots

570
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,650
我们做到了
We did that

571
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,350
但总是很saptto
But it was always saptto

572
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,490
所以基本上我们做了一点小调整
so basically we tweaked a tiny bit

573
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,830
视野或景深
the field of view or the depth of field

574
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,860
我们真正想呈现的体验聚焦于一个非常具体的主题
Itself to actually focused the experience that we wanted to present on a very particular

575
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,300
呃
Uh

576
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,280
图像的一部分
Part of the image

577
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,415
不过，这同样是sapttle，只用了玩家角色状态之间的过渡
However , again , that was sapttle and used only the transition between states for the player character

578
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,940
我们实际上可以控制
We could actually take control over the

579
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,320
玩家会看得那么远，镜头前方
Where the player was looking so over the camera

580
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:23,910
然而
However

581
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,410
因为我们希望玩家始终感受到掌控
Because we wanted the player to actually feel in control at all times

582
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:31,170
而所有实际限制这一点的因素，在现实中都应该被合理化
And everything that actually limited that should be justified in the world

583
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,790
我们很少用玩家Lookuso来控制
We used player lookuso taking over the control very sparingly

584
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,990
而且只有在最极端的例子中才会这样
And in only most extreme examples

585
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,015
我们必须用移动动词来做这件事
Where we had to do that with action verb of moving

586
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:43,750
呃
Uh

587
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,790
我们实际上让玩家可以控制他们站在哪里
We actually gave player control over where , where they stand

588
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,410
所以我们不得不为玩家调整舞台布置方式
So we had to change our approach to this staging for the player

589
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,750
所以，呃，我们必须准备它，而不是为玩家，玩家所在
So , uh , we had to prepare it not for player , where player is

590
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,850
但到底是为了什么，玩家可能在场景中的哪个位置？
But what for what , where player might be in the scene

591
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,500
最终，这也是我们最终得到某种东西的原因
In the end that's why we ended up with something

592
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,220
我们，我们更关注未来阶段
We , we think closer to future stage than anything

593
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,680
而玩家是舞台上的另一位演员
And player is another actor on this stage

594
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,710
呃，我们发明了
Uh , we invinvented

595
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,470
我们想到了“甜蜜点”这个概念
We thought of this idea of sweet spots

596
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,450
这些是画面最佳的视角
Those are vantage points from which scenes look the best

597
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:18,100
我们用尽所有技巧邀请玩家参与
And we used every trick in the book to actually invite players to be there

598
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,260
你可以从提供的例子中看到这一点
And you can see that on the examples provided

599
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,830
呃
Uh

600
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,090
我们用了，呃，光影
We used , uh , lights and shadows

601
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,410
众所周知，玩家天生就被驱使去焊接场所
As we know that players are naturally driven to come to the welded places

602
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,120
我们用了关卡设计和环境
We used level design and our environment

603
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,660
就像上面的例子一样
So as in the top example

604
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,150
你只需要在家具间移动就能看到场景
You just have to move around between the furniture to see the scene

605
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,650
并且，并且作为演员参与其中
And , and be engaged in it as an actor

606
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,380
呃，我们用了其他NPC的塑料化
Uh , we used plastaging of other npcs

607
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,600
如第二个例子
As in the second example

608
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,920
你可以看到花子从钢琴前站起来，转向演奏者
You can see hanako is standing up from the piano and turning towards player

609
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,660
通常这就足以让玩家感到被邀请，主动来找她谈话
And usually that was enough for the player to feel invited and come to her to talk

610
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,587
在
Um

611
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:54,220
我们也需要知道玩家在哪里
We also whenever we really need to know where player is

612
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,360
我们请求场景中的一些互动
We pl some interactions in the scene

613
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,320
因为我们可以将相互作用范围和角度从中煮成
as we could stew the range of interaction and angle from

614
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,280
而这种互动实际上对玩家开放
Which that interaction is actually available to the players

615
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,220
而这些时刻正是我们可以掌控局面的时刻
And those are the moments where we could grab the control

616
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,115
但我们等着玩家激烈地去做这件事，对吧
But we waited for the player intense to actually do that , right

617
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:10,760
一开始我们真的
At first we were really

618
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,220
真的很担心这还不够
Really worried that that's not gonna be enough

619
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,300
玩家们会跳来跳去
And players will end up jumping around

620
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,890
寻找自己角落里的后卫，诸如此类
Looking for backs in the corners of their own and so on

621
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:24,110
然而，很快发现玩家们并不会获得最佳体验
However , it turned out pretty quickly that gamers just won't have the best experience possible

622
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,950
所以大多数录像都会重看
So most recordings rewatch

623
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,080
我们看到玩家以某种方式参与场景
We see players participating in scenes in a way

624
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,880
非常接近我们想象中的那种
Really close to the one imagined by us

625
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,720
我们只给他们留了些衣服
And we only left some clothes for them

626
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,700
呃，等它来了
Uh , when it comes

627
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,310
说到表演
And when it comes to acting

628
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,900
游戏中使用的动画
So the animations that we use in a game

629
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,830
现在我们已经不能再用摄像机和剪辑来隐藏内容了
Well no longer we could basically hide things under camera and editing

630
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,210
动画必须从各个角度都非常出色
Animations had to look really good from every possible angle

631
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,870
因为我们有很多未知数
Because we had a lot of unknowns

632
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,860
他们实际上站在了剧中注视的位置
Where the play is looking or where they are , are actually standing

633
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,650
这也影响了我们的模型设计方法
This also influenced our mock up approach

634
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:01,080
因为我们必须比以往任何时候都更充分地考虑环境因素
Because we had to take into account much more than ever before the environment in

635
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,070
那些场景实际上发生的地点
Which the locations that , that the scenes were actually happening

636
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,820
所以我们不再能简单地在某种抽象空间里播放和录制动画
So no longer we could simply play and record animation in some kind of abstract space

637
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,940
不，我们实际上必须使用游戏内最终使用的地点
No , we actually had to use the locations that we in ended up p using inside the game

638
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,470
你可以想象，这是个巨大的变化
As you can imagine , this was a big change

639
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,530
然而，我们觉得这对整体来说是件好事
However , we felt it was for the better of the , of the whole

640
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,000
也
Also

641
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,420
我们不知道玩家会从哪个角度看到动画，对吧
We didn't know from which angle player will see the animation , right

642
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,660
所以我们也不得不改变这一点，因为你之前的项目
So we also had to change that because you previous project

643
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,960
我们可以在这里为镜头演戏
We could just act out for the camera shot here

644
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,440
这根本不可能
It was just not possible

645
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,270
是的
Yeah

646
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,930
所以我们想给大家展示另一部短片
So we would like to show you another short

647
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,770
呃，亲密场景的样本
Uh , sample of the scene of an intimate scene

648
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,540
呃，我们认为第一人称视角特别好用
Uh , that's that we think uses first person perspective particularly well

649
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,860
使用声音和最接近的角色
Using sound and closest of the characters

650
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:50,675
而且能与整个体验保持非常非常亲密的体验
And the ability to be actually very , very intimate with the whole experience

651
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:55,450
但这从未阻止你采取行动
But that's never stopped you from taking action

652
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,960
去你该去的地方
Going where you needed to go

653
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,070
现在也不会阻止你
and it won't stop you now

654
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,500
但我怎么跟上所有变化
But how do i keep up with everything that's changing

655
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,387
你一直跟得上
You have been keeping up

656
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:14,350
你已经产生了影响
You've made an impact

657
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:23,420
这个世界上没有一件事不是在变成别的东西
Not a single thing in this world isn't in the process of becoming something else

658
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,307
同样
Likewise

659
00:32:25,307 --> 00:32:29,650
你永远不会回头
You never look back

660
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,112
非杀不可，就杀
If you gotta kill , kill

661
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:37,790
如果你非得把一切都烧成灰烬
If you gotta burn it all to the ground

662
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,770
然后让它燃烧
Then let it burn

663
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,960
生后
after life

664
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,780
哦，发生什么事了
Oh what's going on

665
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,837
该死的东西把我赶出去了
God damn thing threw me out

666
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,580
需要和你谈谈。说话
Need to talk to you . talk

667
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,190
你拉了紧急刹车
You pulled the emergency break

668
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,460
为了说话就撕开我
Rip me out just to talk

669
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,940
发生了什么事
What happened

670
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,590
我做错了什么
i do something wrong

671
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,760
现在我们想引导你了解这个框架
So now we'd like to guide you to the framework

672
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,820
我们为自己创造了真正能够做到这一点的过程
We created for ourselves to actually be able to do that

673
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,740
问题在于如何扩展
It was a question of like how to scale

674
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,460
我们游戏的复杂性，我们的电影设计
The complexity of our game of our cinematic design

675
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,600
我们必须思考如何克服挑战
We had to think of how to overcome our challenges

676
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,940
所以给玩家提供了大量动作动词
So providing a lot of action verbs to the players

677
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,640
如果是第一人称视角，实时场景就能全部完成
Having it all done if in first person perspective with real time scenes

678
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,860
诸如此类，呃
And so on , uh

679
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,620
我们必须找到一种方式，让完整游戏玩法之间融合
And we had to find a way to blend between full gameplay

680
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,050
而在我们的设计中，则是完整的过场动画
And full cut scenes in , in our design

681
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,280
呃，对我们来说，既需要它，也需要它作为设计需求
Uh , for us , we also needed it both as a design needs

682
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,060
因此，要创建一个构建模块
So to create a building blocks from

683
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,260
哪些设计师能够创造这些体验
Which designers will be able to create those experience experiences

684
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,880
同时也作为生产工具
But also as a production tool

685
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,170
因为它让我们能够
Because it allowed us to

686
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,970
啊，其实你去看看到底发生了什么
Ah , check what's going on actually

687
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,780
但我们稍后会详细说明
But we will go into that in a second

688
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,910
现在。别害怕。这是个巨大的滑梯，有很多信息
Now . don't be scared . it's a huge slide there's a lot of infor here

689
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,770
但我们会逐一逐一讲解
But we'll go through each , each one separately

690
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,980
所以我们称之为参与的理论框架
So that framework we call it teers of engagement

691
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,740
对我们来说，呃
And for us it's , uh

692
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,020
这些是我们构建游戏中每个场景的基础
Those are building blocks from which we build every scene in the game

693
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,608
还有那些留下玩家控制权的因素
And those leaving how much control player has

694
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:13,449
实际玩家可用的动作动词有多少
How much action verbs are like actually available for the players

695
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:15,969
以及我们希望如何引导他们完成整个过程
And how we want to guide them through the whole process

696
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:18,330
其中一些是个人视角。实际上
Some of them are first personal perspective . actually

697
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,130
大多数
Most of them

698
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,510
其中一些是互动的
Some of them are interactive

699
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,510
而且有些并非完全没有互动性
And some are not none interactive

700
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,579
我们会逐一介绍，向你展示游戏中的运作方式
And we will go through them to show you how it works in the game

701
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:27,210
呃
Uh

702
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,270
所以仔细想想
So when you think about it

703
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,650
呃，订婚的泪水
Uh , tears of engagement

704
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,650
我们这边对信号与噪声问题的回答，对吧
And an answer from our side to the problem of , of of signal and noise , right

705
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,429
如果你的设计充满了未知数
If you have a design with so many unknowns

706
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,449
玩家所在位置
Where the player is

707
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,370
他们正在做的事情
What they are doing

708
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,489
他们在看什么
Where they are looking

709
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,949
我们需要真正有意识地做出决定
We need to actually take a very conscious decision on

710
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,989
场景内部重要
What's important inside the scene

711
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:46,889
信号 ，是场景的信号部分 
The signal , the signal part of of , of of the scene

712
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:50,860
这是我们想告诉玩家的重点
This is the focused thing that we want to tell this that the player

713
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,000
这是一个故事部分
This is a story part

714
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,810
这些是我们希望他们体验的重要关键要素
Those are the important crucial elements that we want them to experience

715
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,150
然而，在其他的，其他的，其他的，其他的
However , on the others , other , other , other

716
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,960
另一端是噪音，呃
Other end of the spectrum there's the noise , uh

717
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,440
这是玩家的自主权
This is the agency of the player

718
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,420
他们能做的一切
Everything that they can do

719
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,620
他们可以自己享受
And they can enjoy on on their own

720
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,260
在
Um

721
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,010
我们只是相信这两者都很有价值
We simply believe that both of those are valuable

722
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,850
以及他们之间的互动
And the interaction between them

723
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:15,780
他们之间的摩擦才是玩家真正有趣的时刻
The friction between them is where the actual interesting moments for the player happen

724
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,600
我们将在叙事层面上使用这些
And where will we can use in a narrative sense

725
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,900
呃，首先，有一个第一层
Uh , to start with , there is a first tier

726
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,880
所以一级完整的游戏体验
So tier one full gameplay

727
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,910
正如我们在这里的例子中所见
As we can see here on the example

728
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,330
井
Well

729
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,430
我们，我们正在
We are , we are being

730
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,790
呃，被邀请到现场
Uh , invited to the scene

731
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,320
然而，没有什么能阻止我们离开或射击他人
However , nothing is stopping us to simply go away or shoot people around

732
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,120
呃，这是完整的游戏演示
Uh , this is full gameplay

733
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,520
所以我们对相机有完全的控制权
So we have full control over the camera

734
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,440
移动，玩家的能力
The movement , the abilities of the player

735
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,740
我们可以利用它
We can use this to

736
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,662
为了在简单的故事内容中呈现一些简单的选择
To deliver some simple choices in simple story content

737
00:35:44,662 --> 00:35:48,000
不过，游戏中保留这一点依然很重要
However , it's still important to have that in the game

738
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,480
因为这实际上赋予玩家对自己体验的主导权
Because this is actually what gives the player the ownership over their own experience

739
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,820
第二次疲劳
Second tired

740
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,180
我们称之为关卡玩法
We call it stage gameplay

741
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,440
这正是我们向玩家引入首次限制的时刻
And that's the moment where when we introduce first limitations to the players

742
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,730
所以 ， 例如
So , for example

743
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,810
我们放慢速度、移动、设置或改变它
We slow down , move , set or alter it

744
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,520
你可以在屏幕上的视频中看到这一点
You can see that on the , in the videos on the screen

745
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,310
例如，在第一个
So , for example , in the first one

746
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,670
当玩家第一次接近杰基以应对减速时
When player approaches jackie for the first time to meet the slowdown

747
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,770
而且有些能力是关闭的，关闭的
And some abilities are turned , turned off

748
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,220
所以玩家实际上可以参与到这种情况中，而不需要更多的，呃
So player can actually be involved in this situation without more of , uh

749
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,590
困惑与能力
Confusion and ability like things to do

750
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,020
呃，第二个例子挺有意思的。虽然
Uh , second example is interesting . though

751
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,320
它不行，或者说，哇
It doesn't work or wow

752
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,340
它不管用
It doesn't play

753
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,930
你玩了还是没玩
Did you play or not at all

754
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,370
哦，抱歉
Oh , sorry for that

755
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,450
哦，也许现在是这样
Oh , maybe now

756
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:33,810
是的
Yeah

757
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,850
地方很酷
Place cool

758
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,550
所以第二个问题很有趣
So second one is interesting

759
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,030
因为我们提供了这些限制，并提供了一些世界观的背景
Because we provide those limitations with some context in world

760
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,240
所以现在有沙尘暴
So there is a sandstorm

761
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
玩家穿过沙尘暴
And player runs through the sandstorm

762
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,160
这就是为什么这些限制被施加
And that's why those limitations are applied

763
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,310
这就是为什么移动速度变慢，移动方式也被改变
That's why movement is slowed down and locomotion is altered

764
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,590
呃，对我们来说，时间一直固定很重要
Uh , for us , it was important until always have the fixed time

765
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,530
为这只牛出现的情境或空间
Situation or space for this steer to appear

766
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,880
因为正因为如此，玩家才能理解这些限制的原因
Because thanks to that , player can understand why those limitations

767
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,390
虽然这条街其实不太像乌米克，呃
Even though not really umeek at this st , uh

768
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,890
但还是感觉像有克莱明，呃，出现了
But still feeling like feeling cleming , uh , appear

769
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,990
这样玩家才能理解它的背景
So players can understand the context of it

770
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,800
而最好的情况是设计师的意愿让玩家参与
and the best situation is when the will of designer to make players

771
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,700
以某种方式参与场景，与
Participate in a scene in some way is aligned with the

772
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,170
呃
Uh

773
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,750
此刻，玩家轮转，球员们是jessee（被转轮的）和jessee（玩家）正在进行
Players wheeled and players are jessee at this moment

774
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,152
这就是我们在引入限制时的任务
So that was our task when introducing and limitations

775
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,720
你可以想象，呃
As you can imagine , uh

776
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,580
其实很容易在限制上过度
It's , it's easy to actually go over board with limitations

777
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,380
因为人们自然需要讲故事
Because of the natural need to actually tell a story

778
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,220
所以很容易过度使用
So it's easy to go overboard

779
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,180
我们需要非常有意识地控制何时真正应用这些限制
And we need to take very , very conscious control over when we actually apply those limitations

780
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,770
呃，第三层，呃
Uh , the third tier , uh

781
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,390
这张照片显示在这里，呃
Which is displayed here , uh

782
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,500
我们实际上被地面上的警察压制住了，呃，对我们来说
We are actually really held down by the police on the ground , uh , for us

783
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,970
这是一个极其强大的工具，可以讲述非常强烈的情感时刻，在游戏中呈现
It's extremely powerful tool to , to tell very powerful emotional moments and in the game

784
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,660
基本上，在这里我们可以推动角色的表演。这里
And basically here we can push the acting of our characters . here

785
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,140
我们知道玩家的位置
We know where the player is

786
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,590
我们也能控制他们实际感知情况的角度
And we have control over the angles that they can actually perceive the situation from

787
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:05,950
呃，这里的选择其实可以非常复杂
Uh , here the , and choices can actually be very , very , very involving

788
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,050
就在这儿。我们可以玩玩，用盘子
Right here . we can play around with , with the plate

789
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,230
演员的立场
The position of the actors

790
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,550
并且完全知道所有东西的位置
And seen knowing fully where the , where everything is

791
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:17,320
但重要的是，我们不能再过度使用
However , what's important is that we can't again overdo it

792
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,150
把游戏变成坐着模拟其实很容易
It's very easy to turn game into a sitting simulator

793
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,470
因为我们想讲述这个故事
Because we want to tell the story

794
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,400
无论我们需要怎样，我们都知道
However we need , we know that

795
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,490
比赛中我们必须避免这种情况
and we needed to avoid that during the game

796
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,930
真正呈现出完整的体验
To actually deliver the full breath of the experience

797
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,170
我们希望玩家们亲身体验
That we want the players to experience

798
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,390
第四层是fbb cutings ing
Fourth tier is fbb cuts ing

799
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,510
所以这些时刻是可控角色移动，镜头跟随的
So those are the moments where playable character is moving and camera follows it

800
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,980
而这些时刻，我们将完全掌控
And those are the moments where we'll have full control over

801
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,500
玩家看到的与这块碎石板的弱点
What players see and weakness on this screte

802
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,240
基本上
Basically

803
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,140
不过，我们有两个非常重要的规则
However , we had two really important rules for those

804
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,240
第一种是Pai已经描述的那种
First is like what pai already is describing

805
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,650
所以必须脱离上下文
So it has to come out of the context

806
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,930
所以大多数情况下，我们会在互动后四人
So in majority we used to four after interactions

807
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,510
所以玩家给了我们真正参与那个呃动画的意图
so player gave us intention to actually participate in that 呃 animation

808
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,670
在其他一些情况下，比如我们使用了外部语境
In some others , like we used external context

809
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,110
但这必须是可以理解的
But it has to be understandable

810
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,340
就像手榴弹在你身边爆炸，你的身体被扔掉一样
Like grenade explosing next to you and your body is thrown away

811
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,807
这也是我们认为舞台设计的好特点
That is something we also consider a good design on the stage

812
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,430
呃
Uh

813
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,150
多亏了对
Thanks to this control over the

814
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,370
呃，抱歉，第二条规则
Uh , sorry , second rule

815
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,270
我几乎怀念那种感觉
I miss that almost

816
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,590
所以第二条规则也非常重要
So second rule and it's really important as well

817
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,610
我们希望这些内容都很短
Is that we want those to be short

818
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,300
所以我们不想有冗长的FPP过场动画
so we don't want to have long fpp cut scenes

819
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,240
因为我们觉得这真的限制了它
Because we feel it's really limiting it that's

820
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,220
为什么我们决定要有短场景
Why we decided that we have like the short scenes

821
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,890
它们在几秒钟内有一次，有时是自由节拍
Which have one , two sometimes free beats inside several seconds long tops

822
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,720
呃
Uh

823
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,450
多亏了这种控制
And thanks to that control

824
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,010
我们也能讲出非常感人的故事
We also can tell really emotional stories

825
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,290
就像提供的例子一样
Like in the examples provided

826
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,750
第一批从我们萨迦塔跳下来的人
First ones jumping down from our saka tower

827
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,610
这对玩家来说是一场视觉盛宴
And it's a spectacle for the player

828
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:48,190
另一个人很亲密，能感受到很多情绪，亲吻你喜欢的角色
The other one is intimate and can tell a lot of emotions kissing character you love

829
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,080
然后是最后的第五层，呃
And then there's the final fifth tier , uh

830
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,470
TPP的全面削减，呃
Full cuts in tpp cuts in , uh

831
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,650
这里我们实际上把摄像机从玩家身体里拿出来了
Here we actually take the camera out of player body

832
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,890
我们用客观相机来判断
And we use objective camera to tell very

833
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,100
我们想讲述的非常特别的故事
Very particular story that we want to tell

834
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,410
所以我们对玩家的体验拥有完全的控制权
So we have full control over the experience of the player

835
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:10,320
它们没有任何可用的互动功能
They don't have any kind of interactivity available to them

836
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,000
嗯，我们现在只用这些来做信任
Um , we use those again only for outtrust

837
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,590
所以在这种情况下，游戏终结，呃
So the game endex in this case , uh

838
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,910
我们觉得它再次成为了强大的工具
We felt it was again powerful tool

839
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,090
但我们需要在合适的时候使用它
But we needed to use it when it did fit for us

840
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,670
而是比赛结束
It was game endings

841
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,630
现在我们想回顾一部短片
Right now we would like to go over a short , uh , short movie

842
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,390
我基本上会为这部电影做旁白
I will basically narrate the movie

843
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,240
还有，呃，描述一下眼泪发生在性方面的变化
And , uh , describe when the change of tears sexually happen

844
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,820
你可能会看到密度有多高
And you will probably see how densely

845
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,280
你真的会带那些东西
You actually pack those things

846
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,307
呃，进入体验
Uh , into the experience

847
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:43,375
所以我们从第二层开始
So we start with the second tier

848
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,010
再
Again

849
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,130
我们有玩家可以完全控制自己的移动
We have a player has a full control over their movement

850
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,732
悬停有些技能比如射击可以选择SA
Hover some abilities like shooting can be sa

851
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:52,820
他们走了，进入冰层后也一样
They go and after you enter the ice too

852
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,660
二四
Two four

853
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,920
所以这个完美的动画
So this perfectic animation

854
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,600
但它们是免费的
But they are in interior free

855
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,780
因为他们坐着
Because they are sitting down

856
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,717
身体仅限于旋转能力
The body is limited to only rotational capability

857
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:04,130
玩家出了问题
Something happened to the player

858
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,930
但他们明白为什么？因为有人确实帮助过他们的护理
But they understood why ? because someone actually did help their care

859
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,090
所以我们明白发生了什么
So we understand what's happened

860
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,505
约翰尼
Johnny

861
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:14,150
但当这种情况发生时，我可以提问
But i can ask a question when this is happening

862
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:19,620
因此，我们对玩家有一定的互动能力和x压抑
So we have some limited capability of interactivity and x depression given towards player

863
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,555
我们曾经真的讲述过这个故事
We used to actually tell the story

864
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:26,240
玩家再次被传送到冰冷的水中的网络空间
Again , player is being transported in the cyberspace in the cold water

865
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,150
所以我在
So the hence i raised in in

866
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,310
对此，它被称为 e
In response to that it's called e

867
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:35,210
玩家可以理解我们为什么又回到了网络空间
Understandable the player why here we are again in cyberspace

868
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,890
这是赛博朋克世界中一个特别的地方
This is a special place in cyberpunk world

869
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,760
而且我们现在的游戏时间有限
And we again in we are in a limited stage gameplay

870
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,280
基本上没有什么技能可用，只有极少数
Where basically no abilities are available except very few

871
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,900
所以，比如移动或环顾四周
So , but such as movement or looking around

872
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,547
这同样被用来以非常特定的方式传达故事
This is again used to deliver story in a very particular way

873
00:41:52,547 --> 00:41:55,950
这是我们的BB堡垒
This is our bbs that a fortress

874
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,710
如你所见
As you can see

875
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:04,610
我们创造了一种叙事语法，基本上贯穿整个体验
We created this narrative grammar that's basically spread throughout the whole experience

876
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,720
比如，比如，或者说所有场景都是定制的
Like , like in which or three all scenes are custom made

877
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:14,470
所以我们能够简单地把玩家的每一秒体验都分成泪水
So we're able to simply go and and divide every second of player experience into those tears

878
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:18,980
我们认为我们当时非常非常强大，对我们来说也是如此
Which we think we were very , very powerful for powerful too , uh , for us

879
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,680
这些设备在制作初期就被要求
They were required at the very beginning of the production

880
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,640
所以，你知道，大约在你的产品实际发货前四年
So , you know , like four years before your product actually ships

881
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,240
我们知道设计必须做好自己的工作
We knew we had to actually do our job well to design

882
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,560
然后再引导这些体验
And then then and direct the experiences

883
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,770
呃，眼泪也让我们能做一些成本和时间预测
Uh , well , tears also allowed us to do some cost and time prediction

884
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,390
因为成本是对称的
Because the cost was a symmetric

885
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,870
也许可以有一个简单的层级
Maybe a simple tier for

886
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,200
所以第一人称视角动画
So first person perspective animation

887
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,760
呃，作为设计师来说其实挺便宜的
Uh , was actually cheap for as designers

888
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,980
但对动画师来说，这些设备可能很贵。另一方面
However for animators , they could be expensive . on the other hand

889
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,970
也许对动画师来说便宜的东西，对我们来说却很贵
Maybe something that was cheap for the animators were actually expensive for us

890
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:57,040
例如，u，裂到裂缝二的场景，带有高级舞台设计
For example , u , the tear to the tear two scene with advanced staging

891
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,200
而且多个角色的作非常耗时
And multiple characters were simply time consuming to do

892
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,940
不过它们依然是非常强大的工具
However they will again , very powerful tools

893
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,797
现在
Now

894
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:06,530
这个眼泪的设计，呃
This design in the tears , uh

895
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,290
我们赋予了我们独特的能力
We're , we're giving us unique capabilities

896
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:15,620
能够保持独特的挑战和视角，面对我们不得不解决的问题，呃
Can keep unique challenges and , and perspective for problems that we had to actually address during this , uh

897
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,680
这个，这个，这个，这个，这个设计，嗯
This , this , this , this design , um

898
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
对我来说也是如此
And for me

899
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,990
最重要的是他们给了这个，嗯
What's most important is that they gave this , um

900
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:26,150
嗯，潜意识中对整个体验的可理解语法层
Um , subconscious layer of understandable grammar towards the whole experience

901
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,460
我们只希望玩家能真正学会
We simply hope that player will actually learn

902
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,740
在这个、在、在、在这个体验中，事物是如何运作的
How things work in this , in , in this , in , in this experience

903
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,800
如果他们点击了什么
If they click something

904
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
总会有事情发生
Something will happen

905
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,697
没有什么东西会突然跳出来
There are no things that simply jump out of them

906
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:38,350
对我们来说
For us

907
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,270
设计和撕字的可理解性极为关键
This understandability of design and tears was , was extremely crucial

908
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,207
即使它隐藏在玩家视线之外
Even if it was hidden from the player's eyes

909
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:48,260
给你一些概览。这是一种简化
And give you some overview . it's a simplification

910
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,700
所以不要太认真地减少
So don't don't reduce to too seriously

911
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,680
但这说明了重点
But it shows the point

912
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,710
所以在像这些免费游戏中
So in a game like which are free

913
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,270
我们有大量游戏和互动场景
We had big chunks of gami and interactive scenes

914
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,790
有时玩家完全无法控制的过场动画会贯穿整个体验
Sometimes cutscenes in which player has no control at all interlates throughout their experience

915
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,110
然而，在赛博朋克中
However , in cyberpunk

916
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:05,790
叙事结构比有机结构更为支离破碎
The structure of narrative is much more fragmented than organic

917
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,050
所以我们换了很多眼泪
So we changed tears a lot

918
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:10,510
正如你在例子中看到的，就像puo所说的，呃
As you saw in the example , like puo narrated , uh

919
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,410
你可以在场景中进行多次变化，比如一分钟内的场景，对吧
You can have several changes throud like one minute of the scene , right

920
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:18,410
所以这改变了你作为玩家在体验中能控制的程度
So it changes how much control you as a player have during that experience

921
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,660
多亏了那个
And , uh , thanks to that

922
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,960
我们认为它可能会对玩家隐形
We believe it might become invisible to the player

923
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,550
所以就像最好的电影剪辑师傅一样
So the same way the best movie edits are like you

924
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,230
别去想编辑的事
Don't think about the edit to you

925
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,410
只要把故事讲出来
Just get the story

926
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,890
你可以通过故事重温
You can relive through the story

927
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,400
多亏了那个语法
And thanks to that grammar

928
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,880
多亏了这种有机结构
And thanks to that organic structure

929
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,240
我们相信我们的叙事语言也会变得隐形
We believe that our narrative language also becomes invisible

930
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,322
并帮助玩家实现无缝体验
And helps player to have the seamless experience

931
00:44:41,322 --> 00:44:43,710
现在给你们展示，呃，图表
And now to show you , uh , graph

932
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,430
这次来自网络潘，那是，呃，场景图
This time from cyber pang , that's , uh , scene graph

933
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,390
实际上，这正是Miki在
actually that's the same power worked on it's a miki seen in

934
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,130
哪位玩家决定v的身体命运
Which player decides on the fate of the body of v

935
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,430
接下来会发生什么
And what will happen next

936
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,170
U，那里有那些较小的深色节点
U again , there are those small darker nodes there

937
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,430
这些就是各部分
And those are the sections

938
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,190
与描述的相同能力
The same ones power described in the

939
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,990
就像谈论推特图表一样
Which like talking about twitter graph

940
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,830
这些内容包含定向内容、动画等等
Those contain directed content , animations and so on

941
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,250
剩下的全部珊瑚礁
All the rest of this coral full reef

942
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,400
我会说，呃，是逻辑笔记
I would say , uh , are the logic notes

943
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,440
这使我们能够引入动作动词
Which allow us to introduce action verbs

944
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,240
这让我们能够，呃，实现互动性
Which allowed us to , uh , give interactivity

945
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,560
交互性也同样如此
Interactivity do the same

946
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,360
所以比较一下这两种逻辑的程度
So compare both amount of logic

947
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,560
因为这两点都是游戏里最精彩的场景之一，对吧
Because those are both like one of the biggest scenes in games , right

948
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,860
逻辑量很大
So amount of logic

949
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,180
我们是电影设计师必须设计的
We are cinematic designers had to design

950
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,580
借鉴任务设计师的经验并向他们学习
Borrowed from quest designers and learn from them

951
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,920
而在我们的电影结构中实现的效果令人震惊
And implement in our cinematic structure is staggering

952
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,220
但我们觉得那些星舰很漂亮
But we feel those are beautiful starships

953
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,420
我们真的很喜欢他们
And we really like them

954
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,530
呃，总结一下
And , uh , as a sum up

955
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,290
想想我们在这次演讲开头给你们展示的两件事
Just think of the two things we showed you at the start of this presentation

956
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,680
一个来自《巫师》，另一个来自《赛博朋克》
One from the witcher and the other from cyber punk

957
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,230
我们用不同的方式来体验这些体验，对吧
We use different means for those experiences , right

958
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:50,570
这两者对玩家来说都很难
Both are difficult for players

959
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:53,150
两者都很吸引人。但叙述方式不同
Both are engaging . but are told in different ways

960
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,290
这正是重点所在
And that's exactly the point

961
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,510
这不是说哪一个更好
It's not about one being better than the other

962
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,170
只是工具不同而已
It's just different toolset

963
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:02,190
我们为讲述的故事选择了最合适的工具组合
And we chose the best toolsets for the stories we were telling

964
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,910
托托实际上让甘普利和故事之间的联系成为可能
Toto actually make the connection between gamply and story possible

965
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,290
所以每当你在做某件事时
So whenever you work on something

966
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,210
只要，呃，有意识地做选菜决定
Just make , uh , conscious dishes decisions

967
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,387
你想用哪些工具
What tools that you would like to use

968
00:46:12,387 --> 00:46:17,900
呃，所以我们想用关于整个设计的一些收获来结束。还有，呃
Uh , so we'd like to finish this up with few takeaways about the whole design . and , uh

969
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,740
我想是我们的，我们的错，呃
I guess our , our faults , uh

970
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,680
说到游戏制作
When it comes to the game production

971
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,330
所以，啊，首先
So , ah , first of all

972
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:28,240
啊，第一人称视角并不自动意味着沉浸式体验
Ah , first person perspect perspective does not automatically mean immersive experience

973
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,980
我们只是认为，你必须努力争取那种美好的沉浸式体验
We simply think that you have to work for the good kind of immersive experience

974
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,400
对我们来说，这花了很长时间，也付出了不少努力
And for us , it took a while and took a of effort

975
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,890
不过，嗯，这并不明显
However , well , it's not obvious

976
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,870
不过，如果你真的，呃，你是可以达到的
However , you can get there if you actually , uh

977
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:43,177
花足够的时间关注整个体验的设计状态
Spend enough time on the design state of the whole experience

978
00:46:43,177 --> 00:46:45,920
帕沃在演讲初期说的
What pavo said , uh , early in the presentation

979
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,880
沉浸式是双刃剑
Immersion is a double edged sso

980
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,210
每当你努力追求最大的沉浸感时
Whenever you strive for the biggest immersion possible

981
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,540
你必须考虑游戏的核心
You have to think of the core of the game

982
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,820
或者因为你正在努力
Or since you are working on

983
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,660
因为玩家会感受到自己身处其中，缺陷会被放大
Because imperfections will be multiplied by the fact that players feel that they are there in the

984
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,860
在这次经历中
In the experience

985
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,842
另一个是，呃
Other one is that , uh

986
00:47:04,842 --> 00:47:06,110
我们的结构
Our structure

987
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:08,190
这种有机结构，呃
This organic structure and , uh

988
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,730
而且它的可预测性
And the predictability of it

989
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,922
所以玩家要理解游戏规则
So player understanding of the rules of the game

990
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:15,220
让所有缝线都看不见了
Makes all the stitching invisible

991
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,740
尽管我们在某个场景中一次又一次地交换了眼泪
Even though we switched tears again and again in a particular scene

992
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,490
即使是在场景的十秒钟内
Even in ten seconds of the scene

993
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:21,630
一切都是隐形的
It's all invisible

994
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,670
如果做得好
If it's done well

995
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,670
如果他们能理解这一切发生的原因
And if they understand why it actually happened

996
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,990
我们觉得这件事非常重要，呃
We feel this is an extremely important on this , uh

997
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,630
这是对玩家网站和设计网站的理解层
This a layer of understanding of , of both player site and , and design site

998
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,690
你可以拥有最好的想法
It's you you can have the best ideas possible

999
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,850
但没有合理的规划和框架
But without proper plan for it and framing for it

1000
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:41,950
一切都会崩溃
It will all fall apart

1001
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,250
而且，呃，当你的艺术家被设计成要框定时，这点很重要
And , uh , it's important when your artists are designed to frame it

1002
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,930
给自己一些限制
To give yourself some constraints

1003
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,100
而是因为这能帮助你提升规模
But because that will help you with scaling

1004
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,820
这样你才能保持游戏体验的一致性和连贯性
That will help you to keep the consistent and cohesive experience

1005
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,680
整个产品过程中
Throughout the whole product you are working on

1006
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,700
对我们来说，是“梗”式的“交战”
For us it was terrier of engagement

1007
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,470
第一人称视角真的很难
First person perspective is simply difficult

1008
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,890
呃
Uh

1009
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,910
这在各个层面上都很困难
It's difficult on every possible level

1010
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,460
在设计师阶段很难
It's difficult on the , the , the designer stage

1011
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,000
在实际生产阶段
On the actually production stage

1012
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,040
当你必须设计和生产工具，在实施阶段实施时
When you have to design and and produce the tools to implemented on the implementation stage

1013
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,740
所以这很重要
So it's it's important

1014
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,380
我认为不可能简单地进入这种设计就说，好吧
I don't think it's simply possible to go into this kind of a design and say , okay

1015
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,700
我们这么做是因为便宜
We are doing this because it's cheap

1016
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,340
这可不便宜
It's not cheap

1017
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,020
这并不容易
It's not easy

1018
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,150
这其实很难，也很复杂
It's actually difficult and complicated

1019
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,640
呃
Uh

1020
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,480
不过，嗯
However , well

1021
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,000
你知道，这个难演的角色其实是那种，通常，比如
You know , the difficult role is actually the one of , of , of often like the

1022
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,010
还有那个农民，有趣的
And the peasant one , the interesting one

1023
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,442
所以我们认为这是一个不错的选择
So we think it was a good choice

1024
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:36,930
最后
And lastly

1025
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,440
我们从那里开始
What we started with there

1026
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,680
游戏乐园故事之间存在摩擦
There is that friction between gameland story

1027
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,160
而且它们配合得最好
And they work best together

1028
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,780
然而，仅仅说你希望他们合作还不够
However , stating that you want them to work together is not enough

1029
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,660
你必须找到你的想法和决定，因为它对你意味着什么
You have to find your idea and decision like what it means to you

1030
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,697
以及这对你的玩家意味着什么
And what it to mean to your players

1031
00:48:51,697 --> 00:48:55,510
对我们来说，是希望玩家成为场景中的演员
For us , it was the decision that we want players to become actors in the scenes

1032
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,130
最后，关于这场对话的结束
And to finish this converse that this talk

1033
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,550
我们想给你们展示一个场景
We'd like to show you one scene in

1034
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:03,430
我们觉得我们真的成功了，玩家们也成了演员
Which we feel that we really succeeded and players became actors in it

1035
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,190
基本上我们就在舞台上
Basically we are on the stage

1036
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,160
我们基本上就像摇滚明星一样表演
We perform as a rock star basically

1037
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,640
看看摄像机发生了什么，因为那不是动画
And take a look at what happens with camera because it's not animation

1038
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,080
我们不是别人
It's not something we are other there

1039
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,940
我们甚至没想过这事
And we didn't even think about it

1040
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,740
有些新手会自己开始做头值银行
there are some newto start head banking on their own

1041
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,280
因为他们认为作为摇滚明星在场是他们应该做的事
As they think that being there as the rock star is what they should do

1042
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,540
所以走在舞台上，表演生活
So walk around the stage and perform life

1043
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,940
让我们为我好好享受一下吧
Let's enjoy it for me

1044
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,640
压迫的天空
Pressing sky

1045
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,660
我们会为你做奴隶
We will be slave for you

1046
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,060
叫它们歌
call them song

1047
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,040
为意面而玩
play for pasta

1048
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,560
他们会
they do wh

1049
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,220
被付钱成为DI的Cpain
paid to be cpain to di

1050
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,290
这就是游戏圈的快速发展
Such is out fast the game scene

1051
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,670
把玫瑰上的洞弄得非常彻底
Get the hole down the rose so so down

1052
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,630
跳舞让我低头
Dance to get my head down

1053
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,490
和
and

1054
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,960
这已经存在了，没有
This is out there s no

1055
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,700
再也不会像以前那样检查MP和Lis
Never the same checking mp down and lis

1056
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,480
所以你自己闪现，把我的chakill都留在四里
So youself flash to keep my chakill in all four

1057
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,920
我喜欢自由
I like to free

1058
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,220
呃，我其实看到几个人，呃
Uh , i actually saw few people , uh

1059
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,560
随着音乐点头
Noding their head to the music

1060
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,600
所以我又想了想
So i think again

1061
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,070
我觉得我们真的成功了
Think we actually succeeded

1062
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:38,140
因此，我们感谢大家再次参加本次演讲
And with that , we would like to thank you for being here with us on this presentation again

1063
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,220
我是帕博·哈斯基
I was pabo huski

1064
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:39,980
我是个哈士奇
I am pero huski

1065
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,560
是的
Yeah , yeah

1066
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,380
你是我，我是天空中的 poki ta machines
You are i'm poki ta machines sky

1067
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,880
并利用这个机会
And using this opportunity

1068
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,460
我想邀请你加入我们
I would like to invite you to join us

1069
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,900
因为我们正在为两个特许经营权招聘
as we are hiring for our both franchises

1070
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,180
我们真的很在找招牌设计师
And we are really looking for sign designers

1071
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,137
也许这激发了你的兴趣，你想参与其中
And maybe that got you interested and you would like to participate in that

1072
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,750
看来我们还有几分钟时间问答
It seems that we still have few minutes for q and a

1073
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,030
不知怎么的，我们其实很惊讶，呃
Somehow we are actually very surprised , uh

1074
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,730
谢谢你,先生
Thank you sir

1075
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:03,310
呃，不过之后我们很想在包装室多和你聊聊
Uh , however after that we would love to actually talk to you more in the wrapper room

1076
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,870
那我们就开始问和娘吧
So let's proceed with the q and niang

1077
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:05,870
谢谢
Thank you very much

1078
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,520
我有两个问题
I have , uh , two questions

1079
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,900
呃，首先，我想说
Uh , first of all , i'd like to say

1080
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,340
感谢你推动叙事渴望游戏
Thank you for pushing narrative longing games

1081
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,200
我感觉就像玩赛博朋克一样，仿佛在见证进化
I felt like , uh , playing cyberpunk that i was seeing an evolution

1082
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,880
最后，经过多年三A叙事
Finally , after many , many years of triple a narrative

1083
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,720
谢谢你的建议
Thanks for that

1084
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,380
嗯，我有两个问题想问你
Um , my two questions for you is

1085
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,960
你是怎么平衡数字的
How did you balance number

1086
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,120
第一个问题是你作为角色和玩家是如何平衡V的
First one is how did you balance v as a character versus player

1087
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,020
作为角色
As a character

1088
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,890
比如你给V和V赋予了多少个性
Like how much personality did you give v versus

1089
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,055
你让玩家带来了多少
How much did you let the player bring

1090
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:44,430
好的，那个，我想是，呃
Okay , that the , i think that's , uh

1091
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:45,890
问题是我们会有多少
The question is how much we

1092
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:51,570
作为艺术艺术家，V的个性有多少被塑造？
How much of personality of v is shaped up by us as these as arts artist

1093
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,230
而有多少是由一个优秀的球员塑造的，对吧
And how much is shaped by a good player , right

1094
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:58,490
我认为此时最好把这个问题交给故事作者和测验设计者
I think it would be better to give this question to storywriters and quiz designers at this stage

1095
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:58,990
可能
Probably

1096
00:51:58,990 --> 00:51:59,370
是的
Yeah

1097
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:03,410
但是，呃，如果你想讲一个带有一些，呃
But , uh , if you want to tell a story that has some , uh

1098
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,390
债务等，你必须做一些约束
Adebt and so on , you have to do some constraints

1099
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,550
对我来说，这和订婚泪水一样
It's the same for me as with tears of engagement

1100
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:08,930
假设
Let's say

1101
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,460
所以存在一些约束
So there are some constraints

1102
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,700
但在这些限制范围内
But within those constraints

1103
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:16,120
我们给玩家很多塑造角色和选择道路的可能性
We give player a lot of possibilities to shape up the character and choose their own path

1104
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,380
所以我觉得这就是我能放弃的最好状态了
So i think that's the best i can give up this state

1105
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:18,780
是的
Yeah

1106
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,570
我会的。我会问一个更贴近问题的问题
I'll . i'll ask a question that's more in line then

1107
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,580
这就是你是如何处理“走出自主权”的
Which is how did you handle walk away with agency

1108
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,042
玩家可以在对话中途离开或返回
Where players could walk away or walk back in the middle of conversations

1109
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:31,230
那么我们要这么做吗，还是要做？
So do we do that or yeah

1110
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:31,350
是的
Yeah

1111
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,710
我知道你在某些地方会这样做
I know you do it in some places

1112
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,330
我只是好奇你是怎么想的
I would just curious how you thought about it

1113
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,390
我们知道是怎么得到的
We know how we got it

1114
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:35,830
算了
Oh well

1115
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:39,520
你知道，比如玩家的自主权和自由对我们来说非常重要
You know , like agency and player freedom again was very important for us

1116
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:39,720
右
Right

1117
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,520
所以我们觉得这根本不可能
So we felt that never possible

1118
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,800
只要我们知道噪音其实相当大
Whenever we knew that the noise is actually pretty high

1119
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,920
我们可以允许玩家直接离开，也许会回来
And we can allow the player to simply walk away and maybe come back

1120
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,340
我们应该这么做，对吧
We should do that , right

1121
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,720
所以，呃，这确实是平衡的问题
So it's , uh , it's a matter of balance for sure

1122
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,360
所以有些情况下我们绝对不能允许这种情况发生
So some situations we simply can't allow this to happen

1123
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,300
因为我们希望信号质量极高
Because we want the signal to be extremely high quality

1124
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,420
而且整体上非常高
And extremely , you know , high in general

1125
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:05,460
不过，有些游戏我们实际上可以让玩家重新拥有主动权，呃
However others where we can actually allow the player to simply have the agency back and , uh

1126
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,630
并且真正批准了这个局面
And actually approve the situation

1127
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,910
他们想怎么做，比如
How do they want to the , for example

1128
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:13,360
我设计的那个，呃，Smash的情况
The , uh , situation with smash that i designed u

1129
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,730
这就是我认为我们可以平衡两者的例子，对吧
This was an example of where i think we could balance both , right

1130
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,230
因为我们处于一个很近的空间里
Because we are in a close space

1131
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,760
我们基本上可以从这件事中抽身离开
We could basically walk away from the come from the situation

1132
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,480
或者我们可以进入一个场景，也许能完成Smash，呃
Or we can engage in situation and maybe finish smash , uh

1133
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,480
然后，杀了他
And , and and kill him

1134
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,240
我想，呃，关于这件事的问题是，玩家什么时候离开了
I guess , uh , the the question about it to is when the player walked away

1135
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,700
你把那个剩下的节点或者东西怎么处理的
What did you do with that leftover node or thing that was sitting there

1136
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,960
如果他们只是喜欢把赢家放进去
If they just like putting a winner

1137
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,640
所以在某些情况下
So in some t situations

1138
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,780
这意味着玩家不想参与这个场景，比如说
That would mean that player doesn't want to involve be involved in this exact scene , for example

1139
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,140
这意味着在叙事上
And that will mean narratively

1140
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,820
所以有时候我们就关上它，对吧
So sometimes we just close it , right

1141
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,090
然而，当我们希望玩家回归时
However , when we want players to come back

1142
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:51,930
我们始终保持故事的信号信号
We keep the signal signal of the story alive at all times

1143
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,750
我们确实做到了
And we try to we did it actually

1144
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:59,170
我们还为NPC准备了一些额外的动画和台词等待玩家
We have some additional animations and lines for the npc to waiting for the player

1145
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,430
当我们接近他们时
And when we approach them

1146
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,950
有时我们还会看到额外的生命，比如说，好吧
Sometimes we also have additional lives saying like , okay

1147
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,150
你回来了，诸如此类
You came back and so on

1148
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,520
比如它回答了这个问题，还是说是想想，好吧
Like does it answer this question or yes think , okay

1149
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,680
所以如果我，如果我指的是，基本上是系统性的
So if i , if i mean basically it was a systemic

1150
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,680
但是，但有方向性经验和，然后对我们来说，是解法，对吧
But , but directed experience and , and then solution for us , right

1151
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,950
所以我们有一套系统
So we had a system in place

1152
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,860
实际上可以直接接入系统播放动画，还有，还有，呃
Could actually plug into the system and play the animations and , and , and , uh

1153
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,020
以及来自角色的回应
And responses from the , from the characters

1154
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,620
不过，我们也自己做了一些定制的解决方案
However , we also made some custom , completely custom solutions on our own

1155
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,180
因为我们的视觉隐晦语言极其强大
Because our visual cryptic language is extremely powerful

1156
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,440
所以我们能动用很多员工
So we're able to to do a lot of staff

1157
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,160
那是非常精准地为那个特定情况手工制作的
That was , you know , that was very precisely handmade for that particular situation

1158
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:34,640
谢谢
Thank you

1159
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,820
我觉得还有一件有趣的事
I think that one more interesting thing

1160
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,950
抱歉，这是个好问题
Sorry , that's a good question

1161
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,660
呃，我们还有一些台词叫打断，比如回嘴台词
Uh , we also had some lines we called interrupts and like comeback lines

1162
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,400
所以每当你在排队时离开
So whenever you left during a line

1163
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,170
NPC会承认这一点并说些什么
Npc would acknowledge that and say something about it

1164
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:46,570
比如，是的
Like , yeah

1165
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:47,650
我们稍后再谈这个
Let's come back to this later

1166
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,290
回来时，这事就被提了出来
And when you come back it's , it's brought up

1167
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:52,110
所以我们切断了它的系统，它就会恢复它原本的音符
So we cut system for it and it would just like resume the note it was on

1168
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:53,350
之后你会
After this you yes

1169
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:55,720
所以我们发布信号，然后复活它
So we post the signal and then we revive it

1170
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,080
但我们必须考虑不同事物的不同状态
But we have to take into consideration different states of different things

1171
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,020
比如说
So for example

1172
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,200
我们不会从动画中途开始，对吧
We won't start in the middle of animation , right

1173
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,480
我们基本上得从头开始
We have to start it from the start basically

1174
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,080
谢谢
Thank you

1175
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,760
凉
Cool

1176
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,760
是的
Yes

1177
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,040
也许，是的
Maybe the , yeah

1178
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,160
让我们一起做这个未来吧。真
Let's do this future . really

1179
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,360
是的
Yeah

1180
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,160
我还有两个问题
I also have , uh , two questions

1181
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,520
呃
Uh

1182
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,680
第一个是
The first one is

1183
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:21,520
你有没有考虑过让玩家表达他们独特的双重个性
have you thought about allowing players to express their own dual individuality

1184
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,740
通过持续使用你提供的动作动词
By being consistently able to use those action verbs that you provided

1185
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,947
比如，呃，比如
And like , uh , for example

1186
00:55:28,947 --> 00:55:32,530
走近去打拳头或靠近亲吻，呃
Walking closer to punch or walking closer to kiss , uh

1187
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,767
有时候，你知道的
Where sometimes , you know

1188
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:37,020
这在上下文中可能说不通
That might not make sense in context

1189
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,500
但被允许这样做，某种程度上给了玩家
But being allowed to do that sort of gives the player

1190
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,100
作为一个角色，我们有自由地表达自己
The , the freedom to sort of express themselves as a character

1191
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,347
他们想要的方式
The way they want

1192
00:55:43,347 --> 00:55:43,870
好
Okay

1193
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:46,127
所以基本上你是在问，嗯
So basically you're asking , um

1194
00:55:46,127 --> 00:55:50,900
我们有没有考虑过让动作世界在游戏中的每个情境都非常有用，对吧
Did we think about allowing the action verse to useful in every situation in the game , right

1195
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,950
呃，我是说
Uh , i mean

1196
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,440
所以这确实是一个非常诱人的想法，对吧
So certainly is a tempting , tempting idea , right

1197
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,340
但是，如果你考虑潜在问题的规模，可能会遇到
But , but if you think about the scale of the potential problems that you would have

1198
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,610
说实话，这本书就是为我准备的
Because honestly this it's for me

1199
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,670
这听起来像是这种亲密的事
This sounds like this kind of intimate

1200
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,150
这不是沉浸式主题，我们不喜欢
Not mersive theme on us

1201
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,080
极限记忆的鳞片分布在整个游戏中
Extrememoth scale being spread out throughout the whole game

1202
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,580
这是我喜欢的创意
Which uan idea that i love

1203
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,720
然而，在这种情况下，我们必须思考
However , in this case , we simply had to think

1204
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,080
好
Okay

1205
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,460
这就是我们想讲述的故事
This is the story that we want to tell

1206
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,900
而且对于某些情况
And for some situation

1207
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,300
这根本不合适
This simply does not fit right

1208
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,380
这不是那种沙盒式的故事体验
It , it was not this kind of a sandbox story experience

1209
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,700
对我们来说，这依然是非常叙事驱动的游戏
Which was still very narratively driven game for us

1210
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,340
虽然我们一开始就是这样
And although we started with that

1211
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,400
我们一直想这样
We , we wanted to have that all the time

1212
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,980
但我们会退缩，找到了这样的路，呃
But we pull back from it as we found our way of like this , uh

1213
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,952
这次我选择了更合适的半自由方法
Have directed half free approach more suitable this time

1214
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:37,790
然后，后续问题是因为没有这种一致性
And then the , the follow up question is because there isn't that consistency

1215
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:42,405
你如何让玩家知道他们在这些情况下可以执行这些动作
How do you let the player know that they can do those actions in those cases

1216
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:43,010
是的
Yeah

1217
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:47,110
所以我们觉得这本可以做得更好
So see that's something we think we could have done better proper

1218
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,550
可能是因为比如
Probably because for example

1219
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,470
这场戏里我们和大乔一起站着，闪耀着
This scene where which we shone with big joe like standing up

1220
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:52,670
然后你就能看着他
And then you could look at at him

1221
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:55,120
等等，呃，这其实是非常隐藏的事情
And so on , uh , that's something that's really hidden

1222
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,820
呃，我觉得这是我们需要注意的
And , uh , i think that's something we

1223
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:00,550
我们可以从中学到，应该更，呃
We could learn from it that it should have been more , uh

1224
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,210
我不知道怎么说得很明确，可能是很明确
I don't know how to say that explicit , explicit probably

1225
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,370
或者我们可以学习
Or maybe we could learn

1226
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:07,450
但要在游戏开始时更好地教导玩家这一点
But teach players at the start of the game better ly of that

1227
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:07,910
是的
Yeah

1228
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:11,270
呃，所以我们，我想这就总结了，对吧
Uh , so we , i think that that sums it up , right

1229
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,530
这回答了你的问题吗
Does does that answer your question

1230
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:12,810
是的
Yes

1231
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:13,510
谢谢
Thank you

1232
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,520
谢谢
Thank you

1233
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,130
你好
Hi

1234
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:15,750
很棒的谈话
Great talk

1235
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,457
我有个问题，关于，嗯
I had a question about , um

1236
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:19,840
你是怎么导演的
How you directed this

1237
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,460
所以其实没有太多第一人称电影可以作为参考
So there aren't a lot of first person films that you could have used as a reference

1238
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,640
所以你在创造一整套视觉语言
And so you're kind of creating this whole visual language

1239
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,980
你们的迭代周期是怎样的，是做分镜然后做定型的吗
How , what were your iteration cycles like did you storyboard and then block it out

1240
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:38,380
还是你只是先在场景中坐下来，看看什么效果不错
Or did you just sort of set down in a scene and see what worked

1241
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,710
所以一切又是分层次的交战
So it's all again , tiers of engagements

1242
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,250
在这方面真的非常有用
Were really really useful in that matter

1243
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,590
因为我们可能会用不同的管道
Because like we could have different pipe

1244
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,490
我应得。因为我需要重复这个问题
Ah deserve . because i need to repeat the question

1245
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:50,040
所以问题是我们到底是怎么做到的，对吧
So question is how we actually did it , right

1246
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,520
我们是如何引导这款应用体验的流程的
How we what was our process to direct this app experience

1247
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,240
呃
Uh

1248
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,470
比如说，对于五级
So for example , for tier five

1249
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,050
分镜很容易，对吧
It was easy to storyboard , right

1250
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:58,930
因为这是插队
Because it's a cut in

1251
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:01,720
所以我们可以使用我们熟知的UA管道
So we could use ua pipeline well known for us

1252
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,500
或者之前的，之前的作品
Or from previous , previous titles

1253
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:08,890
至于其他部分，我们首先想到的是，呃，主烟雾
For the rest though , we first think of the let's say , uh , main puffs

1254
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,470
我们试图想象它们
And we try to visualize them

1255
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:13,110
所以你可以说是分镜
So there is you can say storyboarding

1256
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:17,300
因为我们会根据场景的节奏来绘制不同的分镜
Because we storyboard different deeps to , to beats of the scene to understand

1257
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,750
最终会是什么样子
How it will look like in the end

1258
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:23,010
我们做了一些俯视视角，配合一些动画路径
We did some top down views with some animated let's say , uh , paths

1259
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:25,790
玩家如何感知最终的场景，呃
How player can perceive the scene in the end , uh

1260
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:30,430
当我们有一场无tir的场景时，情况就不一样了，我们知道，呃
And it was different when we had a tir free scene where we knew , uh

1261
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:34,920
莫尔斯几乎完美地判定玩家将看到的内容
Morse rules almost perfectly what player will see

1262
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,280
而且每个玩家能移动的顺序也不同
And it was different for like since in which player was able to move around

1263
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,510
所以这是一个学习过程
So it was a learning process

1264
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,830
我们不得不尝试很多东西
We had to try out a lot of stuff

1265
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:46,570
最终我们发现，这是一种混合体
And in the end we found a it's a mix of

1266
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,840
比如电影式的制作和增益设计
Let's say movie like , like production and gain design

1267
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,360
我会说
I would say

1268
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,360
所以原型和分镜混合在一起
So prototypes mixed with storyboards

1269
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,620
所以我们用粉色的假蝇做了
So we did a pink fly on that

1270
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,120
凉
Cool

1271
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:54,680
谢谢
Thank you

1272
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,180
谢谢
Thank you

1273
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,640
呃，抱歉
Uh , sorry

1274
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,720
你还有时间再来一次吗？
Do you have time for one more or not

1275
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,470
我觉得我们还有一场
I think we one more

1276
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,150
好，再来一个
Okay , one more

1277
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,140
谢谢
Thank you

1278
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:02,910
你好
Hi

1279
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,430
呃
Uh

1280
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,590
非常感谢你的分享
Thank you so much for the talk

1281
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,470
真是太棒了
It is amazing

1282
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:05,990
在
Um

1283
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,600
这有点像两部分
This is kind of a two parter

1284
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,592
那么，显然会有许多不同的场景
So how often , so obviously you have scenes that have many different beats to them

1285
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:13,140
呃
Uh

1286
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,980
你有多频繁地在眼泪之间切换
How often have did you find yourself swapping between tears

1287
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,940
或者像泪水间隙做B测试来弄清楚
or like a b testing between tears to figure out

1288
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,230
哪些是最适合那种感觉的
Which ones were the right feeling for that

1289
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,780
你要给玩家
You want to give to the player

1290
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,890
然后又回到那个阶段
And then to that

1291
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:26,930
调整你的节点系统有多容易
How easy was it to adjust your node system

1292
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,530
因为我喜欢那个真筒的场景
Because i saw like for that makoshi scene

1293
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,480
那真是一团糟
That was a cathu looking h mess

1294
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,860
但同时，调整起来有多容易
But at the same time , like how easy was it to adjust

1295
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,520
当你在那个场景上反复迭代时
When you were iterating on that scene

1296
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,120
并且努力让它达到那个程度
And trying to get it to that point

1297
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,980
Ui， i， 我可以从第二个开始
Ui , i , i can start with the second one

1298
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,500
我是说，u
I mean , u

1299
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,820
我，我不是程序员
I , i'm not the programmer

1300
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,780
所以当我们扩展场景系统时，情况是这样的
So when we expanding on the scene system is like this

1301
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,460
编程方面不是我父亲
The programming side is not my father

1302
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,550
不过，呃，我是个设计师，嗯
However , uh , i was a designer that , um

1303
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,300
确实很难
It was difficult for sure

1304
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,260
因为复杂度实际上会 ，对吧
Because the amount of complexity actually going to , right

1305
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,260
以及你需要做的改进工作量
And the amount of improvements that you have to do

1306
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,940
或者直接调用被调用的编辑器来支持，比如
Or to the called editor itself to actually support , for example

1307
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,770
预览这些不同的游戏行为场景
Previewing of those different scenarios of playing behavior

1308
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,120
呃，比如说，在我们的案例中 ，是
Uh , in our case , for example

1309
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,560
编辑器里有互动预览非常重要
It was extremely important to have like an interactive preview inside the editor

1310
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,200
所以，真正能玩游戏
So actually being able to play the game

1311
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,690
能够演奏分支
Being able to play the branch

1312
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:15,220
或者甚至可以预先烤一根树枝
Or even maybe prebake the branch

1313
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,580
所以我们实际上知道并且可以以某种方式保存节点的状态
So we actually know and can save somehow the state of the node

1314
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,260
所以我们实际上可以跟随它们。真
So we can actually follow them . true

1315
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:20,770
右
Right

1316
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,840
嗯，我，我希望这能回答你的问题
Um , i , i hope that answers your question

1317
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,400
所以确实很难
So it was difficult for sure

1318
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,320
而且我喜欢用“两个名字”来形容我的“可爱”
And it i , i , i love the two name for my cutising

1319
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,812
谢谢你，h
Thank you , h

1320
01:00:29,812 --> 01:00:30,250
好
Okay

1321
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,030
第一个问题是关于什么时候使用哪一年，对吧
And the first question was about when to use which year , right

1322
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,800
比如我们该如何处理这件事
Like how do we approach this

1323
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,040
不好意思
Sorry

1324
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,620
比如你能不能重新审视第一部
Like if you could repraise the first one

1325
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,680
比如你多久会反复迭代一次
Like how often do you find yourself iterating

1326
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,360
或者像交换眼泪来测试它们
Or like switching oubing tears to test them out

1327
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,990
所以，哦，我会说，就像，你知道的，游戏
So , oh , i would say like , you know , game

1328
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,570
这是一个反复进行的过程
This is a reiterative process

1329
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:49,240
比如，有很多次我们对这个场景有一些想法
So like , there were numerous times when we had some idea for the scene

1330
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,200
我们做了一些分镜和原型
We did some storyboards , prototypes

1331
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,120
事实证明，这并不是我们想要的粉色
And it turns out it's just not it's not the pink we want to have

1332
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:59,930
所以，呃，玩家自由度之间一直有不断的拉搡
So , uh , there is , there was this all constant pushing between like freedom of player and , uh

1333
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,770
呃，方向近，对
Uh , directed nearrative , right

1334
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:03,750
这也是我们玩过的
And that , that is something we played around

1335
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:09,040
而眼泪，是用来相信的手段，以便切换窗口
And tears were , were was a mean to believe to be able to switch windows

1336
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,890
所以有些场景我们会想到，那个场景也会是你
So there were situations when we thought of a scene that it's gonna be you too

1337
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:13,510
例如
For example

1338
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:14,730
他们可以自由活动
They will be able to move around

1339
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:18,310
但后来我们发现，我们提供的信息可能会被遗漏
But then we found out that information given by us can be just missed

1340
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,630
我们现在不希望有人想念他们
And we don't want them to be missed at this point

1341
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,930
反过来我们也感觉到，好吧
And the other way around as well that we feel , okay

1342
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,830
这对玩家来说真是令人疲惫的体验
This is really meeting that's tiresome for players

1343
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:29,400
所以也许我们可以转向一些自由，给他们机会
So maybe we could switch to some freedom and give them opportunity

1344
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,640
就像是场景中更像一个机构
Like more of an agency in the scene

1345
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,980
说实话，这非常令人兴奋
Honestly , it was very exciting

1346
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:37,740
实际上，给玩家们一个机会，让他们用任何必要的方式表达自己，对吧
Actually give this opportunity to the , for the players to express themselves by any means necessary , right

1347
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,490
比如说，国王砸手
So for example , kings smasher

1348
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:42,650
我喜欢我们能在完整游戏中实现这一点
I love that we're able to actually deliver this on full gameplay

1349
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:45,230
至于叙述方式的决定
And the decision when it comes to the narration of it

1350
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:48,220
所以无论你是把他留在那里，还是当场杀了他
So whether you leave him there or simply kill him on the spot

1351
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,880
我喜欢我们能完全通过游戏玩法来实现这一点，然后说，好吧
Like i love that we're able to simply do this fully on gameplay and say , okay

1352
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,570
这是你的游戏，这是你的体验
This is your game , this your experience

1353
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,320
随心所欲
do as you wanted to do

1354
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,070
所以我觉得我们已经完成了
So i think we were finished

1355
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,310
是的，抱歉，我们已经没有时间了
Yes i'm sorry we are out of time out this

1356
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,750
非常感谢，谢谢你
