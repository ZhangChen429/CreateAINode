啊，在我去上班和做其他事情之前

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,730
呃，关于为什么理解故事结构对于游戏开发者来说是有用的技能
Uh , about why understanding story structures is useful skill for games developers

44
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,585
通常，这实际上是已经凭直觉完成的事情
And often it's actually something which is already done intuitively

45
00:01:52,585 --> 00:01:54,470
这就是有趣的事情之一
So that's one of the interesting things about this

46
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,270
我要说的很多事情你都可以走了
That a lot of stuff that i'm gonna say you can go

我们，我们已经做了一些这样的事情
We , we kind of already do some of that

49
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,450
这是我将其带入意识领域的一种方式
And it's a way of me moving that into kind of a conscious realm

50
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,770
我们可以看一个可靠的故事
We can look at a reliable stories

51
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,390
您可以使用的讲故事结构
Storytelling structure that you can use

54
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:16,920

Uh , there's gonna be two takeaway diagrams at the very , very end of this session

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,030
所以当我在最后最后说了谢谢之后
So after i said thank you at the very , very end

56
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,620
有两张照片可以拍照
There are two pictures which you can take photo of

57
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,980
它会给你大量的总结
And it'll give you loads of summary

58
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,130
关于我今天所说的事情的信息
Information about the things i've been saying today

59
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,650
所以我们要讨论如何构建这些
so we're gonna talk about how to build those

60
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,390
并为您准备了一份美味的简单外卖
And a nice easy takeaway for you

61
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,610
如果你想在节目结束时拿起相机
If you want to bring up a camera right at the end of

62
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,140
这涉及很多内容
This is a lot to cover

63
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,420
所以我要说得很快
So i'm gonna be talking fast

64
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,560
关键点将出现在我身后的屏幕上
The key points are gonna be on the screen behind me

65
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
我有英国口音
I have an english accent

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,110
并非所有人都是以英语为母语的
Not all of you are native english speakers

67
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,710
呃
Uh

68
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,830
所以如果你不能，呃，就太容易跟随了
So if you can't , uh , follow too easily

69
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,750
如果你看屏幕
If you look at the screen

70
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,590
随着我们的进行，你会明白所有要点
you're gonna get all the main points as we go

71
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,790
那么让我们开始讨论一下流动游戏
So let's start off talking a little bit about flowing games

72
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,180
这是我们都明白的重要事情
This is something that we all understand is important

73
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,950
我们通常用图表来表达
We usually express this as a diagram

74
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,970
我们在金钱和技能方面面临挑战
Where we've got challenge on money and skill on the other

75
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,650
如果它是，呃，如果它的技能非常低
And if it's , uh , if it's got very low skill

76
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,390
呃，抱歉，下面的挑战对技能要求非常高
Uh , sorry , very high skill requirement below challenge

77
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,400
然后游戏就变得很无聊
Then game becomes quite boring

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,930
如果它的技能从低到低
And if it's got a low to low skill

79
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,970
但挑战太高，游戏变得太难
But high challenge and the game becomes too difficult

80
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,770
ERROR
It makes players really anxious

81
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,890
所以我们真的决定我们应该尝试并保持
So we decide really that we should try and keep

82
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,507
留人就是所谓的流量通道
Keep people what's called the flow channel

83
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:18,020
现在我们开始认为这是一条直线
Now we started off thinking that this was kind of a straight line

84
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,280
挑战和技能应该在彼此完美的关系中升级
That challenge and skills should escalate in perfect relationship to each other

85
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,410
但我们确实发现这更有趣
But we've discovered really that it's kind of more fun

86
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,145
如果是的话，如果我们沿着那里走的那种波浪形的摇摆线
If it , if this kind of wavy wobbly line that as we go along there

87
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,550
现在，如果你想了解更多关于心流的知识，这里有一些很棒的人
Now , if you want to learn more about flow there's some great people

88
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,030
你可以，呃，读一遍又一遍
You can , uh , read up on and over chan

89
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,920
杰西·谢尔给我哈雷六号发给我哈雷，呃
Jesse schell me harley six sends me harley , uh

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,830
他是那种想出了很多这样的东西的人，嗯
He was kind of guy who came up with a lot of this stuff , um

91
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,060
很难找到一个
Tricky one to search for

92
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,340
ERROR
Just go mahi and flow

93
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,680
它会出来油炸和谷歌，嗯
It will come out frying and google , um

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
这些人在 Flow 方面做出了惊人的工作
These people have done amazing work on flow

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,775
查一下
Look it up

96
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:50,972
现在当我们考虑讲故事时，呃，意图
Now when we think about storytelling , uh , intention

97
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:53,110
我们也可以用图表来表示
We also can express this as a diagram

98
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,370
而我们也经常这样做
And we often do so

99
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,150
我们经常在一侧感到紧张
We often have tension along one side

100
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,040
时间沿着故事的底部从零到百分之一百
And time going along the bottom there from zero to one hundred percent of our story

101
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,310
ERROR
And as we go through

102
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,350
我们有一些煽动事件
We have kind of the the inciting incident

103
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,590
第一个峰值是哪个
Which is that first peak

104
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,730
我们可以有一个低中点
We can have a low midpoint

105
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,710
事情出乎意料地变得更糟
Where things have got worse unexpectedly

106
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,810
当我们尝试修复它们时
When we tried to fix them

107
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,700
我们有最后的写作“黑色时刻”
We have that final what's called the black moment in writing

108
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,020
最大的黑暗时刻威胁着我们
Where there's kind of this moment of the greatest darkness threatens us

109
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,380
ERROR
And then we eventually overcome it

110
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,620
这是我们故事的结局
Which is the end of our story

111
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,250
现在实际上一般稍微多一点
Now it's actually generally slightly more

112
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,750
ERROR
Sort of nobly than that

113
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,150
我会解释为什么它有点多
And i'll explain why it's a bit more

114
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,270
比后来的还要高贵
Nobly than that in the later on

115
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,030
但正如你所看到的，当我们可以将这两个想法放在一起比较时
But as you can see , when we could kind of compare these two ideas together

116
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,660
我们看到，如果经过很多次，仍然有这个东西
we see that there's still this thing there that if a lot of times gone along

117
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,850
而且没有发生紧张，那就很无聊了
And no tension happened , then it's quite boring

118
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,270
它说，呃，非常紧张
And it says , uh , have really high tension

119
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,270
而且过去的次数并不多
And not a lot of times past

120
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,710
然后就感觉太紧张了
Then it feels too tense

121
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,092
感觉不自然
It doesn't feel natural

122
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:44,420
所以我们可以看到两者的切割组合
and so we can see there's kind of this cut combination of the two that

123
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,155
ERROR
We have these things that go in common between them

124
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:47,880
一
Um

125
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,965
但这种摇晃的线实际上代表什么
But really what does that kind of wobbly line actually represent

126
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:54,020
ERROR
What is this thing when we talk about games

127
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,450
这是什么，这是怎么回事？
What is , what is this thing going on here

128
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,780
现在当我们思考这个问题时
Now when we think about this

129
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,070
我们可以考虑一下你的游戏的故事是什么
We could think about what is the story of your game

130
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,600
现在我们可以走了
Now we can kind of go

131
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,330
ERROR
Well , your game has things that we might call pre authored content

132
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,800
这就是事件和内容之类的东西
So this is things like events and content

133
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,240
讲故事、、、、机制
The storytelling , the , the , the mechanics

134
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,420
它所在的世界
The world that it's in

135
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,865
这些是我们放入游戏中来讲述游戏故事的东西
These are things that we put into our games to tell the stories of them

136
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:20,197
另一方面，我们有我们的球员
On the other hand , we've got our players

137
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:21,990
太棒了，一大群人
Awesome , huge bunch of people

138
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,390
他们所有人都在玩这种东西，享受其中的乐趣
All of them playing , having fun with this kind of stuff

139
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,082
我们可以称其为用户生成的故事版本
We could call this a user generated version of the story

140
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:29,140
这就是他们与世界的互动
This is their interaction with the world

141
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,260
这是他们对世界的诠释
And it's their interpretation of the world

142
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,380
因为我们设计的世界可能不是他们看到的世界
Because the world that we design might not be the world that they see

143
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,212
因为他们根据自己玩游戏的经历和周围的世界对事物的解释不同
Because they interpret things differently based on their experiences are playing games and the world around them

144
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:41,830
所以在这两者之间
So between the two of these

145
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,432
我们可能会得到不同的东西
We might get different things

146
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:46,540
想象一下我们有一个世界，里面有一辆汽车在赛道上
So imagine we've got a world which has a car in it on a race track

147
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,660
而且它位于城市中心
And it's in the middle of a city

148
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,340
嗯，我们已经有了一个叙事背景
Well , we've already got a narrative setting there

149
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,140
我们了解汽车
We know about cars

150
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,447
我们了解城市
We know about cities

151
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:53,110
比赛开始了
And it starts off the race

152
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,740
在你和到达之间有这样的来回
And there's this back and forth between you and arrival

153
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,680
然后最后一个弯道即将到来
And then on the final bend is coming up

154
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,980
对手就在前面，最后一个角球响亮
And the rival is just ahead and loud final corner

155
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,760
竞争对手的驾驶技术不太好
The rival doesn't drive particularly well

156
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,690
你成功地把它带入了内心
And you managed to take it on the inside

157
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:10,165
奇妙的兴奋和可爱的小故事都可以浓缩在那一刻
Fantastic excitement and lovely little story can encapsulated in that moment there

158
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:12,950
这是游戏中的一个小故事
That's a tiny little story within a game

159
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,010
我们可以看到，我们是否考虑故事中的张力
And we can see that whether we think about tension in stories

160
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,822
或者我们是否将其视为流程
Or whether we think of this as flow

161
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:19,500
这基本上是一个故事
This is basically a story

162
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,400
这两行符合这里的经历
These these two lines fit with this experience over here

163
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,880
现在作为开发者
Now as as developers

164
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,170
我们通过人工智能塑造了它
We shaped that through the ai

165
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,610
也许我们在人工智能上做了橡皮筋，以确保我们的对手在最后一个弯道上很接近
Maybe we did rubber banding on the ai to make sure that that our opponent was close on that final bend

166
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,600
但愚蠢到我们刚经过那里就撞车了
But stupid enough to crash just as we were taking past it there

167
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
我们通过轨道设计对其进行了更改，以确保它很有趣
We changed it with a track design to make sure that it was fun

168
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,950
故事的节奏中会有令人兴奋的直角和弯角
That there was gonna be straight and corners that felt exciting and built in this rhythm of a story

169
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,105
他在哪里踢球
Where is he played

170
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,690
而从玩家的角度来看
And from a player's perspective

171
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,050
当他们运用自己的技能时
While they were using their skill

172
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,950
他们的选择
Their choices

173
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,290
他们控制弯道的方式为自己创造故事
Their their ways of controlling the corners to create that story for themselves

174
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,177
所以这两件事基本上创造了他们之间的玩家体验
So these two things have basically created the player experience between them

175
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,150
这条线
This line

176
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,270
他们创造的这个故事
This story that they've created

177
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,165
这条不稳定的线基本上就是这些之间的地方
This wobbly line is basically the the place between these

178
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:10,550
理想情况下，这就是我们作为游戏开发者所做的事情
And ideally that's the thing that we make as games developers

179
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,870
我们创造这种体验
We create that experience

180
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,170
我们为它创造空间
We create that space for it

181
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,427
我们帮助我们的用户实现这一点
And we help our users get to that point

182
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:18,290
那么我们如何做这种事情
So how do we do this kind of stuff

183
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,480
因此，流量理论认为，让玩家留在该流量通道中是件好事
So flow theory says that it's good to keep players in that flow channel

184
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,720
我们知道那是留住它们的好地方
We know that that's a good place to keep them

185
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,220
但我们如何做到这一点
But how do we do this

186
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,480
嗯，还有很多其他基于力学的想法
Well , there's lots of other ideas out there based on mechanics

187
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,530
但讲故事的人拥有结构化的系统，几千年来他们一直在可靠地使用这些系统来创造出色的观众体验
But storytellers have structured systems that they've been reliably using to create great your audience experiences for millennia

188
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,060
因此，与其重新发明轮子来理解玩家体验，不如
So rather than perhaps reinvent the wheel for understanding a player experience

189
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,120
我们可以从讲故事的人身上学到很多东西，了解他们如何塑造体验
We can learn a lot from storytellers in how they shape experiences

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,445
他们如何引导玩家的情感旅程
How they guide the emotional journey the players go on

191
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:51,580
所以我们要做的就是构建一个图表
So what we're gonna do here is gonna build in a diagram

192
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,175
其中涵盖了讲故事的基础知识
Which covers the basics of storytelling

193
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:57,680
我们将会有，呃，一些关于动机的小东西
We're gonna have , uh , some little bit of stuff about motivations

194
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,420
我们可以了解一些有关场景结构的东西
We can have some stuff about scene structure

195
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,292
很多事情都是从开始到结束的流程
And a lot of it is gonna be about a flow from beginning to end

196
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:05,190
大部分覆盖从百分之零到百分之一百，还有一点点
Mostly covering from zero to one hundred percent with a little bit more

197
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,220
最后还有一点
And a little bit at the end

198
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,000
整个图表将显示在这张幻灯片的最后
This whole diagram will be shown at the very , very end of this slide

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,120
所以不需要拍照
So you don't need to take photos

200
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,480
随着我们的进展逐步进行。顺便一提
Progressively as we go . by the way

201
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,090
除非你愿意
Unless you want to

202
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,720
呃
Uh

203
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,645
我还将填写一些有关每个时刻发生的情况的信息
And i'm also gonna be filling in some information about what happens at each juncture there

204
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:21,140
那么让我们开始讨论动机
So let's start off talking about motivations

205
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,380
这是讲好故事的关键部分
This is a really key part of of telling a good story

206
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,400
所以对于人物来说
So for characters

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,280
这些动机分为外部动机和内部动机
These are divided between external and internal motivations

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,600
外部动机是改变外部世界某些事物的愿望
An external motivation is the desire to change something in the world outside you

209
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,568
所以这往往是为了变得更富有
So this is often to get richer

210
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,980
从银行偷一些钱
To steal of some money from a bank

211
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,419
或者通过做某件事而变得富有和出名
Or become rich and famous through doing a particular thing

212
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,740
这是一种非常常见的外部动机
That's a a very common external motivation

213
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,945
它会改变你在外界的地位
It changes your status in the outside world

214
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:47,240
还有一个就是去旅行
Another one is to travel

215
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,800
你想要到达某个地方
You want to reach to a certain place

216
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,520
你想探索一个新领域
You want to explore a new area

217
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,480
作为你的改变
As a as a a change in your

218
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,442
呃，根据你所在位置的状态
Uh , status in terms of your location

219
00:08:55,442 --> 00:09:01,150
建立友谊、爱情和人际关系正在改变你的关系状态
Forming friendships and love and relationships is changing your relationship status

220
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,925
这是在外界的一种状态
It's a status in the outside world

221
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,230
情绪在某些方面是一种内在的东西
Emotions are an internal thing in some ways

222
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,590
但它们如何影响外界仍然是外部动机
But how they affect the outside world is still an external motivation

223
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,770
例如，可能是和办公室里的帅哥约会
So it could be to date the hot guy in the office , for example

224
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,850
这可能是游戏的目标或你的角色的目标
That could be the objective of the game or for your character

225
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,520
所以就动机而言
So in terms of motivation here

226
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,687
内在动机是改变人内心某些事物的愿望
And internal motivation is a desire to change something inside the person

227
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:25,010
这通常被称为“征服一个省”
This is usually , uh , termed like overcoming a province

228
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,570
所以克服障碍
So overcome a block

229
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,250
这往往是情感障碍
It's often an emotional block

230
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,150
克服孤独感
Overcoming a sense of loneliness

231
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,410
克服悲伤
Overcoming , uh , grief

232
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,032
现在复仇是外在的事情，因为你影响了对外界的复仇
Now revenge is an external thing because you affect revenge on the outside world

233
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:40,780
克服悲伤是其中的内在部分
Overcoming grief is the inside part of that

234
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,852
你试图通过杀死外界的人来克服悲伤
You try to overcome grief by killing people in the outside world

235
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:46,070
这就是很多电子游戏情节的运作方式
That's how a lot of video game plots work

236
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,870
另一个内在动机是学习新东西
Another internal motivation is learning something new

237
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,697
通常这是他们应该已经知道的事情
Usually it's something they should have already known

238
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:56,035
你可以在一个方面成功，在另一个方面失败
And you can succeed in one and fail in the other

239
00:09:56,035 --> 00:10:00,260
通常当你在外部激励方面取得成功而在内部激励方面失败时
And often when you succeed in external motivation and fail on internal motivation

240
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,942
你会看到一场悲剧，那就是罗密欧与朱丽叶
You get a tragedy that's romeo and juliet

241
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:05,460
两个家庭在尊严上是相似的
two families are alike in dignity

242
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,480
他们实际上从未接受过他们应该停止战斗的事实
who failed to actually ever come to terms with the fact that they should stop fighting

243
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,650
以及他们学习新东西的内在必要性
And their internal necessity to learn something new about themselves

244
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,180
ERROR
To learn that they're all the same to learn to accept their differences

245
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,430
如果他们不这样做就会杀死他们的孩子
And their failure to do that kills their children

246
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,570
这就是为什么这是一场悲剧
And that's why that's a tragedy

247
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,342
所以学习新东西是内部改变的一件大事
So learning something new is a huge thing of an internal change there

248
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:32,880
现在这两件事，就像我说的，都是关于改变的
Now both of these things , like i say they are about change

249
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,600
故事总是与变化有关
A story is always about change

250
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,410
一个改变。一个从头到尾没有变化的故事
A change . a story that doesn't have change from beginning to end

251
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,940
ERROR
Is a very , very boring story

252
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,297
现在可能只是你的角色拥有更大的枪
Now it can just be that your character got bigger guns

253
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:44,800
让我们换一种方式
Let's change of a kind

254
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,680
你知道
You know

255
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,080
而且效果很好
And it works pretty well

256
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,760
确实如此
It really does

257
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,160
呃
Uh

258
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,840
我知道我不会放弃游戏
I know i'm not putting down games

259
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,680
这纯粹是关于机械进步
Which is just purely about mechanic ical advancement

260
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,520
这也很有趣
That's a lot of fun as well

261
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,760
但我们还可以做其他事情来改变
But there are other things we can do to change

262
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,240
所以这种改变必须以某种方式发生
So that change must happen in some kind

263
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,300
但我们如何将所有这些东西应用到游戏中
But how do we apply all this kind of stuff to games

264
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,805
好吧，我们可能不认为托里亚斯是一款情节最精彩的游戏
Well , we might not think of torias a game with the greatest of plots

265
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:08,762
但它确实很好地遵循了这些事情
But it really does follow these kind of things pretty well

266
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:11,210
这是一种非常非常引人入胜的玩家体验
It's a very , very compelling player experience

267
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,290
现在如果我们考虑一下
Now if we think about this

268
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,380
如果我们考虑一下我们玩这个游戏时所经历的紧张弧线
If we think about kind of the tension arc that we go through when we're playing this

269
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,740
很适合那种流动的东西
It fits that flow thing

270
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,280
很合适。就是那个张力方舟
It fits . its that tension ark

271
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,680
玩家有外部目标和内部目标
And the player has both external , internal goals

272
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,620
我们将分数作为外部目标
We have the scores as an external goal

273
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,700
我们有这个内部目标
We have that internal goal

274
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,080
这是一种对秩序的渴望
Which is kind of a desire for order

275
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,845
俄罗斯方块的驱动因素是我们希望世界比实际情况稍微整洁一些
Tetris is driven by the thing that we like the world to be slightly neater than it is

276
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:32,800
这是一个很小的地方，也许
And this is a tiny place where maybe

277
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,460
也许会成功实现它
Just maybe will succeed in making it happen

278
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,900
而且总是悲剧
And it's always a tragedy

279
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,120
因为我们总是失败
Because we always fail

280
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,400
但我认为内部目标是俄罗斯方块持久吸引力的一个非常强大的部分
But i think that internal goal is a really powerful part of the lasting appeal of tetris

281
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,240
那种渴望秩序的感觉
That sense of desiring order

282
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,990
它总是从我们身边赶走
And it always chasing away from us

283
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,490
这是一次非常人性化的体验
That's a very human experience

284
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,410
我认为这就是它对我们具有持久吸引力的原因之一
And i think that's one of the reasons it works as such an enduring appeal for us

285
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,430
所以如果你快速将其添加到我们的图表中
So if you add that quickly into our diagram

286
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,870
那里有，呃，门
There we have the , uh , the door

287
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,860
动机是寻求改变
Motivation is a looking for change

288
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,620
通常表达这些非常直接的动词，例如保存和查找之类的东西
Usually express these very direct verbs like save and find and things like that

289
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,120
内部是关于克服或接受
and internal is about overcoming or coming to terms with

290
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,180
所以让我们继续讨论情节结构
so let's move on to plot structure

291
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,740
你已经为你的玩家角色设定了目标
You've got your goals for your player character

292
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,930
外部有内部动机
External internal motivations there

293
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,702
现在我们需要一个财富结构化的系列事件，通过这些事件将会发生变化
Now we need a wealth structured series events through which change will happen

294
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:24,220
外在的目标只是一个愿望
The external goals are just a desire

295
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,480
ERROR
We need the plot to make that change happen

296
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,960
所以，呃，情节控制着整个过程的进展速度
So , uh , a plot controls the speed of progress through the

297
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,540
穿越张力方舟的体验
Through the tension ark of the experience

298
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,842
所以我要更详细地讨论这个情节是如何运作的
And so i'm gonna be talking a little bit more in detail about how this plot works

299
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:39,270
所以在大事件开始之前开始你的故事
So start your story before the big events begin

300
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,345
这是很多游戏都未能正确做到的一件事
This is one thing that a lot of games fail to do properly

301
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:48,052
我的意思是，你不应该以你是巫师哈利开始你的故事吗？
By this i mean don't you don't start your story with you're a wizard harry

302
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:51,260
你和德斯利见面的整个部分
You you have this whole part of meeting the durslees

303
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,820
你有他的，他的童年
You have his , his childhood

304
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,270
他的，他在巫师世界之外的正常日常生活
His , his normal everyday life outside of the wizard world

305
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,590
在你来到这里之前，你会看到海格
Before you here you see the you see kind of hagrid

306
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,970
进来之前先体验一下魔法世界
Come in before you experience the world of magic

307
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,430
因为魔法世界本身毫无意义
Because the world of magic by itself means nothing

308
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,800
除非与平凡的世界形成对比
Unless it's contrasted by the world of the ordinary

309
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,850
我们有时会在游戏中看到这种情况
We see this sometimes in games

310
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,510
当我们这么做的时候，波斯王子就非常强大了
And when we do it's very powerful prince of persia

311
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,550
时间之声是我最喜欢的讲故事游戏之一
Sounds of time is one of my favorite storytelling games

312
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,900
一开始就有一些正常的片段
And there's got a little snatch of normality at the very beginning of it

313
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,940
真的很漂亮，很可爱的游戏
It's beautiful , really lovely game

314
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,220
所以你设置了你的角色
So you set up your character

315
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,460
二、本次活动的情况及基本规则
The situation and the basic rules of this

316
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,922
这也称为教程任务
This is otherwise known as a tutorial mission

317
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:28,090
你可以这样做
You can do it that way

318
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,550
你确实可以做到
It's you can literally do it

319
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,750
将其置于正常世界
Set it in a normal world

320
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,250
使命召唤有时会这样做
Call of duty sometimes does this

321
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,762
在你去射击之前你要在基地进行训练
That you train on the base before you go and shoot

322
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:37,480
意识形态上与你对立的人
People who are ideologically opposed to you

323
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,460
所以你
So you

324
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,620
我本来不想从事政治
I wasn't gonna do politics

325
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,280
我说我会的，嗯
I said i would , um

326
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,650
所以在事件开始之前就开始你的故事
So start your story before the events begin

327
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,660
如果可能的话，与你的角色建立同理心非常重要
It's really important to build empathy with your characters if possible

328
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,020
所以我们希望这个角色能够克服我们面前的挑战
So we wanted the character overcome the challenges ahead of us

329
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,300
啊，这真是一个很好的例子，我认为是看火人
Ah , really great example of this , i think is firewatch

330
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,220
我认为看火人在这方面做得很好
I think firewatch had done beautiful work with this

331
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,260
所以在我们到达看火湖之前
So before we reached the lake in firewatch

332
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,330
这才是故事真正开始、紧张气氛开始的时候
Which is really when the story begins to kick off and that tension starts

333
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,680
我们对哈利了解很多
We know a lot about harry

334
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,440
我们,我们知道他的外在内在动机
We , we know about his external internal motivations

335
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:15,890
故事从那一刻开始，他的外部动机真的被公园里的麻烦所激发
And the story begins with that moment there that his external motivation is really kicked off by there's trouble in this park

336
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,670
所以我们有了这些内部的东西
So we've got this internal stuff

337
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,390
需要逃避的成长
That growth that need to escape

338
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,215
我们知道在某个时候他将不得不回去
And we know at some point he's gonna have to go back

339
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:23,610
这是一个不错的设置
It's a nice setup

340
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,410
它使游戏的其余部分变得强大
And it makes the rest of the game powerful

341
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,232
如果我们从与少女的对抗开始
If we just started with that confrontation with the , the teenage women

342
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:32,160
呃，可能效果不太好
Uh , it probably wouldn't work so well

343
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,890
然后我们就发生了所谓的煽动事件
And then we have what we call the inciting incident

344
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,120
所以现在你是玩家角色，知道自己在世界上的位置
So now you're player character knows their place in the world

345
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,220
我们可以开始为他们设置挑战
We can start to set up the challenges for them

346
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,220
所以我们在这里增加叙事或机械张力
So we increase the narrative or mechanical tension here

347
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,030
我们给对手或敌人增加风险
And we add the antagonist or the enemies the risk

348
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,270
或者我们，我们打破了平常的情况，一些正常的事情
Or we , we break the usual situation , something which was normal

349
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,310
每一天都变得不那么正常
And every day becomes less normal

350
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,750
突然停止工作
Suddenly it stops working

351
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,270
看看斯坦利寓言中的内容
See it's in the stanley parable

352
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,590
按钮停止转动
The button stops going

353
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,910
克服这个问题通常是你情节的外部动机
Overcoming this problem is usually the external motivation of your plot

354
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,150
试图找到问题的根源并
Trying to find the source of that problem and

355
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,000
让一切恢复正常通常是主角的动力
And bring it back into normality is usually what drives your main character

356
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,660
但首先，尽管玩家角色回避了这个问题
But to begin with , though the player character avoids the problem

357
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,160
玩家通常不会直接解决问题
The player doesn't usually go straight to attacking the problem

358
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,040
他们要么探索自己的能力，要么探索世界
They'll either explore their abilities , explore the world

359
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,540
他们会避免面临的大问题
They'll avoid the big issues that's facing them

360
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,185
虽然一路上有一些较小的战斗
Although have some smaller battles along the way

361
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:25,260
所以在 vv , vv , vv , 呃
So in vv , vv , vv , uh

362
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,300
从现在开始我也称之为尖峰，呃
Which i also called spikes from now on , uh

363
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,140
所以在尖峰比赛中
So in spikes to play

364
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,710
角色必须拯救他们的同事
A character has to rescue their colleagues

365
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,570
这是一个非常可爱的小游戏
It's a really lovely little game

366
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,830
这让我想起了杰西说过的很多话
It reminds me a lot of jess said

367
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,970
威廉真是个可爱的小游戏。非常非常有趣
William is really a lovely little game . is very , very fun

368
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,930
但首先
But to begin with

369
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,550
基本上玩家会漫无目的地闲逛
Basically the player wanders aimlessly

370
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,910
真的，这就是你所做的
Really that's what you do

371
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,030
你不，你没有让你失望
You don't you're not set you off

372
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,780
我会立即找到大家
I shall find everybody immediately

373
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,682
现在你去玩吧，你就会看到世界上有什么样的谜题
Now you go off and play and you see what the kind of puzzles are in the world

374
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,700
经过一段时间的其他探索
Now after a little while other exploration

375
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,385
他们做出有意图的选择
They make a choice to act with intention

376
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,240
毕竟，这部剧给人的感觉是他们对这片土地足够了解，可以进行这场战斗
After all , the play feels like they know the territory enough to make that fight

377
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,230
集中选择行动
Focus choice to act

378
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,300
或者别无选择，只能行动
Or there's no choice left , but to act

379
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,220
您已完成所有提交
You've done all the submissions

380
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,140
你必须去看一个故事
you have to go to a story one

381
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,040
在尖峰中，这基本上意味着我最好更多地使用地图
In spikes , that means basically i'd better use the map more

382
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,480
如果你曾经玩过这个游戏，文斯
If you ever played the game , vince

383
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,120
你就走吧，是的
You kind of go , yeah

384
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,880
我迷路了
I'm lost

385
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,835
好的
Okay

386
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:13,720
这是什么闪烁的大象
What is this flashing elephant

387
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,380
一
Um

388
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,790
他们致力于实现外部目标
They engage with the external objective of the

389
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,550
他们面前的故事或世界
The story or the world that's ahead of them

390
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,705
那是他们真正开始涉足这个领域的时候
And that's when they really begin to kind of get into this

391
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:23,250
但当他们进一步深入时
But as they get further into it

392
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,910
复杂性开始增加
The complexity begins to increase

393
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,920
这些能力似乎，嗯，不太有效
The abilities seem , um , less effective

394
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,420
也许会添加新的敌人
Maybe new enemies are added

395
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,880
哪个伙伴，哪个更有挑战性
Which mate , which are more challenging

396
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,700
新的故事元素表明事情并非如此，是的
New story elements show that things were not so , yeah

397
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,070
并不像我们想象的那么简单
Not so simple as we thought they were to begin with

398
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,120
我认为俄罗斯方块是杰作
And i think tetris is a masterpiece

399
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,740
正是因为这一刻
Because of exactly this moment

400
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,012
复杂性突然增加
Suddenly complexity is increased

401
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:49,610
突然间我们知道前方将会有困难
And suddenly we know that there's going to be difficulty ahead

402
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,650
我们必须采取一种策略，将东西堆叠起来
and we're gonna have to a strategy of just piling things on top of each other

403
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,950
现在是一种将事情隐藏起来的策略
Is now a strategy of slipping things underneath

404
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,750
快要搬出去了
Just about quickly moved out

405
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,950
哦不
Oh no

406
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,630
突然间复杂性增加了
Suddenly the complexity is increased

407
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,790
这本身就是一个讲故事的时刻
And this is a storytelling moment in itself

408
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,500
我认为必须增加复杂性才能使体验引人注目
I think the complexity has to increase to make the experience compelling

409
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,220
否则它会停留在这种平坦的水平
Otherwise it stays at this kind of flat level

410
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,059
紧张的气氛没有改变
The tension doesn't change

411
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,619
这样复杂性就可以通过叙事术语而改变
So that complexity can change through narrative terms

412
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,400
机械术语，或通过两者
Mechanical terms , or through both

413
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,020
如果可以的话我两个都喜欢
I like both if you can

414
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,392
但你可以通过叙述来做到这一点
But you can just do it with narrative

415
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:20,970
我认为如果你制作纯粹的叙事游戏，这是一种非常有效的方法
I think that's a really valid way of doing it if you're making purely narrative games

416
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,760
所以在弗吉尼亚州，我们看到了主角之间的分歧
So in virginia , we see divisions between the protagonists

417
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,160
梦想开始对现实提出质疑
And the dreams begins to call some of reality into question

418
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,840
这是我们陷入火中的日常环境的复杂化
And this is a complexification of the everyday setting that we , we'd gone into in fire

419
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,760
观看额外的阴谋
Watching extra lay of conspiracy as added

420
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,960
公园里不仅有女性失踪，还发生了其他事情吗？
Is there's not just missing women there's some other stuff going on in the park

421
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,360
它会得到一点所有
And it will get a bit all

422
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,280
这很酷
It's cool

423
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,925
我喜欢我自己的游戏。他的碎片
I love the game in my own game . fragments of him

424
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:48,660
呃，威尔一直在努力建立一种、一种、一种长期的合作关系
Uh , will's kind of been trying to build a , a , a big long term relationship

425
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,580
读到一半他开始怀疑
And halfway through he begins to doubt

426
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,237
他能否在不伤害他人的情况下玷污一段关系
Whether he can stain a relationship without hurting other people

427
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:54,990
这是一个很大的疑问时刻
It's a big doubtful moment

428
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,270
这是，这是一种
And this is , this is kind of the

429
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,950
大多数故事的中低点
The , the , the low midpoint of most stories

430
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,240
所以最初的策略和武器已经不够了
So the first strategies and weapons are no longer enough

431
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,950
通常在射击游戏中，会添加新的敌人模式和组合
Usually in shooters , new patterns and combinations of enemies are added

432
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,430
呃，我认为超级巨星尘埃往往会在中途添加一些新东西
Uh , something i sua superstar dust tends to add a new things halfway through

433
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,057
敌人使用更好的瞄准更多子弹或追踪错过岛屿
Enemies use a better targeting more bullets or homing miss isles

434
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:16,440
敌人再次开始变得危险
Enemies again begin to kind of get dangerous

435
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,560
新能力，例如快速移动或在死亡时跟踪你
New abilities like moving fast or tracking you in left for dead

436
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,480
你不会把这些东西扔给玩家
You would not throw these things at the player

437

人们常说，我的结局要到什么时候才会是你？

您可能已经注意到结尾处缺少一些内容
you may have noticed there's a bits missing at the beginning of the end there

512
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,340
因为这是大多数故事作为玩家角色旅程的模型
Because that's a model for most stories as a player character journey

这适合最强烈的体验
This fits most strong experiences

It works on an intuitive and emotional level to feel very rewarding

您可能需要考虑在一开始就添加
You might want to consider adding at the very beginning

521

这就是所谓的抓取器
Which is called the grabber

522
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,430
这是一种行动恐惧的爆发，预示着游戏的未来
It's a burst of actional fear that promises for future of the game

523

并在煽动事件发生前放慢速度
And slows down before the inciting incident

524
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,050
所以这是让玩家角色知道前方将会有令人兴奋的事情的一种方式
So it's a way to let the player character know there's gonna be excitement ahead

525
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,630
然后你稍后给他们一点喘息的空间
And then you give them a bit of breathing space later on

For example

抱歉，呃
Sorry , uh

Um , really , i jj abrams is a master of the grabber

548
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,280
我认为这是一件非常重要的事情
It's a very important thing , i think

549
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,620
但如果你能在恐怖故事中做这种事
But if you can do that kind of stuff in horror stories

550
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,980
最后你常常也会有最后的恐惧时刻

so we just add those quickly at the beginning of the end of that structure . here we go

ERROR
This model works is a metastructure for the entire game

577

578

00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,490
所以如果你想创造一个好的场景，就用它来工作
So if you want to make a good scene to be to , to work with that

586
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,957
为此我们需要一个简单一点的指南
We need a little , little simpler sher guide for that

587
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:04,970
基本上，我们想把它变成那种高贵的版本
Basically , we want to turn this into that kind of nobly version

588
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,500
那么我们该如何去做呢
So how do we go about doing this

589
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,490
好吧，我们用场景结构来做到这一点
Well , we do this with scene structure

590
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,060
这是该图的最后一部分
It's the final part of that diagram

591
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,930
我们要在那里添加
We're gonna add in there

592
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,940
所以你所在关卡中的所有场景都必须有一个目标
So all scenes on your level must have an objective

593
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,542
这是玩家的目标或经验
Which is the player's target goal or experience

594
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,330
你必须有冲突，一些能够实现目标的东西
You must have conflict , something that makes the objective

595
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,140
更难到达，就像，呃
More difficult to reach it's like , uh

596
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,440
这可以是叙述性的，也可以是机制性的，或者两者兼而有之
This can be either nnarrative or mechanics or both

597
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,740
某种让我们挣扎的冲突
Some sort of conflict that makes us struggle

598
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,720
让我们更难实现这些事情
Makes it harder for us to make these things happen

599
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,412
然后通过要求角色玩家做出改变来达到结果
And then outcome is reached by requiring change from the player of the character

600
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:35,070
所以他们要么解决冲突，要么适应冲突
So they either resolve or adapt to the conflict

601
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,550
构建故事体验的下一部分
Building to the next part of the experience of the story

602
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,270
故事随着那里的紧张局势不断升级而继续下去
And the story goes on with escalating tension there

603
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,790
你会得到这些漂亮的小峰
And you get these nice little peaks of

604
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,510
哦，我会成功的
Oh i'm gonna make it

605
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,830
哦，不，这并不更令人期待
Oh no , that wasn't more expected

606
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,610
哦，我是
Oh i am

607
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,470
你会得到这些小张力方舟
You get these little tension arks coming all

608
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,620
一路走来都有
All the way along the way there

609
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,730
这是《外星人大战》中的联盟角色
So this was the league character from aliens vs

610
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,970
掠食者或这方面的作家
Predator or a writer on this one

611
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,430
呃，你的首要目标之一就是重置殖民地
Uh , one of the first objectives you get is to reset the , the colony

612
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,510
呃，权力，让它发挥作用。再次
Uh , powers to , to make it work . again

613
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,730
冲突就是力量
The conflict is the power

614
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,110
pler成功重置断电
The pler successfully resets the cut power

615
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,410
ERROR
But it blows the circuits across the colony

616
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,280
所以之前殖民地实际上面临的风险更大
So the colony is actually more at risk before

617
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,240
而且人物的生活也更加复杂
And the character's life is more complex

618
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,087
现在请注意，玩家成功了，而角色失败了
Now notice here that the player succeeded whilst the character failed

619
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:15,120
所以只要你有路标，你仍然可以获得玩家的成功
So you can still have player success as long as you signpost

620
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,710
干得好，你做对了
Well done , you've done the right thing

621
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:21,020
你的玩家的生活现在更糟糕了，但没关系
Your player's life now sucks even more that's perfectly fine

622
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,000
事实上，我强烈鼓励您尽可能多地这样做
In fact , i thoroughly encourage you to do that as often as possible

623
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,200
因为如果你的角色的生活很轻松
Because if your character's life is easy

624
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,130
他们，他们的故事通常很无聊
Their , their story is usually pretty boring

625
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,940
所以尽可能多地尝试玩这种东西
So try and play with this kind of stuff as much as you can

626
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,770
所以另一个例子可能是上帝
So another example for this might be the god

627
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,970
可能是战神系列
Might be god of war series

628
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,390
目标是继续杀死一切
Where the objective is to continue killing everything

629
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,010
呃
Uh

630
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,190
然后你就有了冲突
And then you have the conflict

631
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,790
谁用盾牌对付敌人
Which is who gets enemies with shields

632
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,380
阻止通常的攻击
Which block the usual attacks

633
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,850
所以玩家必须开始使用新的攻击才能进步
And so the player has to start using new attacks to progress

634
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,230
让游戏更具挑战性
Making the game more challenging

635
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,170
玩家的复杂性增加
The complexity increases for the player

636
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,970
没有改变的性格
The character that has not changed

637
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,312
这个角色只是想让他们杀死一切
The character just wants to keep them killing everything

638
00:25:55,312 --> 00:25:57,240
所以在这里我们再次看到我们有
So here we see again that we've got

639
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,140
我们在场景中不断升级的小便控制
We've got that escalating little pee control in a scene

640
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,120
但这一次对于玩家的复杂性来说却是相反的
But it's working the other way around for the , for the players complexity this time

641
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,870
所以让我们在其中添加它
So let's add that in there

642
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,910
所以我们有我们的目标
So we have our objective

643
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,427
我们有我们的冲突，我们有我们的结果
We have our conflict and we have our outcome

644
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:12,200
这将出现在最后的幻灯片上
This will be on the final slides

645
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,040
你不需要去思考
You don't need to go think

646
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,200
我现在就要改变它，已经太晚了
And i'm gonna change it now ha too late

647
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,160
一
um

648
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,425
游戏就是玩家的故事
For games are players stories

649
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:21,940
所以如果你的游戏感觉平淡
So if your game feels flat

650
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,760
然后将你的、你的玩家体验视为一个故事，这是调试它的好方法
Then think of your , your players experience as a story is a good way of debugging it

651
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,620
想想他们正在经历的事情
Think about what they're experiencing as they going through it

652
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,390
所以这里有四个调试问题要问
So here are four debug questions to ask

653
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,370
呃，在游戏、事件或关卡中感觉令人满意
The , uh , in a game , event or level feels on satisfying

654
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,277
我也会在最后放一张图表
And i'm gonna put a diagram of this at the very end as well

655
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:36,960
好的
Okay

656
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,840
呃，这个地方目标明确吗？
Uh , is the place objective clear

657
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,920
是否存在不断升级的机械或叙事冲突
Is there an escalating mechanical or narrative conflict

658
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,160
或者只是重复
Or is it only repetition

659
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,520
我们以前做过吗
Have we done this before

660
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,240
结果是否对机制、叙事或两者都有有意义的补充
does the outcome meaningfully add to the mechanics , the narrative or both

661
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,040
整场比赛就是他们从开始到结束的变化
And over the whole game was their change from start to finish

662
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,442
对于玩家、角色或两者
For the player , the character or both

663
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:59,690
这种改变是非常关键的事情
That change is a really key thing

664
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,310
让你的游戏体验感觉良好，真的很重要
To making your game experience feel good , really really important thing

665
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,810
所以这件事就这样结束了
So it's gonna conclude this

666
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,500
现在结束这一切
Wrapping this all up now

667
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,890
好的设计已经被直观地使用了
Good design is already intuitively used

668
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,742
因此故事结构可以创造引人入胜且有益的游戏
So story structures to create compelling and rewarding games

669
00:27:14,742 --> 00:27:18,720
尽管我认为有意识地学习是一种强有力的理解方式
Learning to do so consciously though i think is a powerful way of understanding

670
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,420
我们如何有意识地利用故事塑造美好体验
How we shape great experiences using stories consciously

671
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,880
了解人们所经历的紧张局势
Understanding this tension ark that people go through

672
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,220
这是波峰和波谷
That it is peaks and troughs

673
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,620
不是一条直线是一件非常重要的事情
Not a straight line is a really important thing to do

674
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,200
因此，无论您的游戏是叙事性的还是机制性的
So whether your game is narrative or mechanics oriented

675
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,527
学习像讲故事的人一样思考可以帮助您做出明智的以玩家为中心的设计选择
Learning to think like a storyteller helps you make intelligent player focus design choices

676
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:38,790
我希望您觉得这次演讲有趣且有用
I hope you found this talk interesting and useful

然后我将展示这两个图
Then i'll show the two diagrams

684
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,200
我们都可以拍照片之类的东西
And we can all take photos and stuff like that

685
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,497
一
Um

686
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:56,520
在那之前我想说玩得开心

708
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,750
关于如何使用它们的一些提示
Some tips about how to use them

709
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,010
什么样的事情可能会给你带来问题
Kind of , what sort of things are probably causing you problems

710
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,110
如果你必须这样做，呃，如果你自己没有得到这些问题的好的答案
If you have to , uh , if you don't get a good answer to those questions for yourself

711
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,500
凉爽的

712
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,190
好的
Okay

713
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,150
我们有时间提问还是必须现在就结束
Do we have time for questions or do we have to wrap up right now

714
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,722
我想我们可能得结束了
I think we probably have to wrap up

715
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:01,060
有一个包房
There is a wrap up room

716
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,892
这是二二二
Which is two o two two

717
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:06,530
我想他们说的是二二二
I think they said two o two two

718
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,230
这是正确的吗
Is that correct

719
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,170
这是正确的
