我的谈话，呃
Of my talk , uh

99
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:28,080
我将展示我们在网络银行这样的大型游戏中的演出方法
I will show our approach to the staging in such big game as cyber bank

100
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,960
2077
two thousand and seventy seven

101
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,947
网络银行与冬季免费有很大不同
Cyber bank is very different from the winter free

102
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:42,940
也就是说，我们必须采取新的方法
And that's , we had to come with new approaches

103
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,735
那件事，呃，当然也不例外
That things , uh , of course was not the exception

104
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:50,870
让我们来看看这些关键方面
So let's go through those key aspects

105
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,370
这也说明了这两款游戏之间的差异
Which illustrates also the differences between those two games

106
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,685
第一个方面，我们也很有发言权
The first aspect , it was us also very vocal

107
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:04,370
这是视角
It's perspective

108
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:11,122
第一人称视角是沉浸式故事的自然选择
First person perspective view is natural choice for immersive story

109
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:13,150
展现沉浸式商店
To showing immersive store

110
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,767
然而，这会导致某些复杂性
However , it leads to certain complexities

111
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:22,440
fpp 中的相机很难制作动画
The camera in fpp is difficult to animate

112
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,595
以及动画数据中的任何错误
And any error in animation data

113
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:29,940
稍后对那些动画数据进行计算
Later on calculation on those animation data data

114
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,350
之后动画图状态的变化对于玩家来说是非常明显的
And later on animation graph state changes are very visible to the player

115
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,800
我想给你看一个例子
I want to show you one example

116
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,470
嗯，首先打破 fpp 视图的沉浸感有多容易
Um , how easy to break the immersion in fpp view first

117
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,927
嗯，请关注左侧动画
Um please focus on the left hand side animation

118
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:54,790
观察几秒钟
Watch it for a few seconds

119
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,870
慢慢来
Take your time

120
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,640
可能注意到现在将注意力集中在右手动画上几秒钟
probably notice that now focus on the right hand animation for a few seconds

121
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,212
非常光滑
It's very smooth

122
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:22,370
你有没有注意到这个突然的动作有多么令人恼火
Have you noticed how irritating was this sudden movement on

123
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,080
在左侧动画的相机上
On the camera on the left animation

124
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,470
所以你可以理解那些相机后背有多痛苦
So you can understand how painful those camera backs are

125
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,457
他们如何给我们带来问题
How they was problematic for us

126
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:35,000
这就是问题所在
And here what was the problem

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,111
被指控的错误，因为动画没有按时加载
The error accused , because the animation didn't load on time

128
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:43,560
第一个唯一的第一帧没有按时加载
The first only first frame did not load on on on time

129
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,510
并且动画混合计算不正确
And animation blending was incorrectly calculated

130
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,210
一个非常明显的例子
A very visible example

131
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,670
微小的问题可能会被破坏，而整个片段可能会被破坏
Where the tiny problem can break and entiresegments

132
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,430
这真的不重要
And it's really not important

133
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,590
其余部分有多流畅
How fluent rest of the stuff is

134
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,500
动画怎么样，嗯
How the animation , um

135
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,560
呃，演员们都很流利
Uh , on actors are fluent

136
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,680
资产如何好
How the assets are good

137
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,120
一切都坏掉了
Everything is , uh , broken

138
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:15,855
第二个方面。对于我们所有的游戏来说，玩家也是非常重要的一个方面
Second aspect . and it's also very important aspect for all our game is the player

139
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,460
这是一个演员
It's an actor

140
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,070
您可以在此示例中看到如何从不同角度呈现一个团队
You can see on this example how one team can be presented from different perspectives

141
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,897
玩家正在积极参与 stm
Player is taking active part of the stm

142
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:29,380
正因为如此，在大多数情况下
And because of these , in most cases

143
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,140
不可能使用很常见的
It was impossible to use very common

144
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,365
烟镜技术降低生产成本
Smoke and mirror technique to reduce production costs

145
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:40,830
网络朋克中的玩家可以看到
Player in cyber pank can see

146
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,290
而且这里也比预览中要讨论的内容要多得多。游戏
and also here much more than in previews to depate . the games

147
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,920
第三个方面是女主角还是男主角
Third aspect is female or male protagonist

148
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,330
在赛博朋克中
In cyber punk

149
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,690
百分之九十的场景有两种差异
Ninety percent of the scenes came in two variance

150
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,870
1个4女v，1个男v
One four female v and one for a male v

151
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,840
这增加了对话的复杂性
This increased complexity of the dialogue

152
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,540
在很多情况下，每条 v 线都有两个版本
Each v lines comes in two versions in many cases

153
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,060
响应也有两个版本
Also there are two versions of response

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,900
嗯，对于女性 v 来说，samscenes 必须以不同的方式构建
Um samscenes must be constructed differently for the female v

155
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,855
对于主 v 来说则不同
And differently for the main v

156
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:24,360
最好的例子当然是任何浪漫的事物
The best examples are of course any romance things

157
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,700
但这不仅是因为我们有更多这样的例子
But it's not only that we had much more of those examples

158
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,540
好的
Okay

159
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,220
所以我们已经知道了关键方面
So we already know the key aspects

160
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,690
现在我想进入工具集
Now i want to go to the tool set

161
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,000
我将描述我们的工具以及稍后的方法，呃
And i will describe our tool and later how , uh

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,880
展示如何使用它来构建场景结构
Show how to use it to build scene structure

163
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,470
嗯，我们管道的核心是 syeditor
Um , the heart of our pipeline is syeditor

164
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:58,750
它由四个尖塔预览视图、端口时间线、剧本和，呃，图表组成
It consists four minareias preview view , port timelines , screenplay and , uh , graph

165
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,790
第一个最引人注目的是，呃，预览视口
First most noticeable is , uh , preview viewport

166
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:12,650
嗯，这就是设计师在之前的会议中组成并修改世界的地方
um , that's where the designer consisting during the previous sessions and modify the world

167
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:22,457
第二个是时间轴面板，其中包含动画、视觉效果、效果、外观剪辑等事件
Second is the timeline panel with the events like animations , vfx , fx , look cuts

168
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:24,740
对话活动等
dialogue events and more

169
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,840
接下来，呃，是一张图表
Next , uh , is a graph

170
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,130
我们已经看到了游戏逻辑
We've seen and game logic

171
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,170
最后一个有趣的是屏幕播放
And the last one for interesting is the screen play

172
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,110
带有对话台词和对话选项
With the dialogue lines and dialogue options

173
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,380
一
Um

174
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,000
我想向您展示该图的一些特征
I want to show you a few characteristic of the graph

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,350
嗯，是方向
Um , it's direction

176
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:50,920
现在
Now

177
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,670
在实践中这意味着什么
what it means that in practice

178
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,270
这意味着信号需要来自一个音符的输出
It means that signal needs to go from the output of one note

179
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,420
并转到另一个音符的输入插座
And go to the input socket to the another note

180
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,490
一般而言，节点左侧可以有多个输入和输出
Nodes can have many inputs and outputs on left by general

181
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,750
在左侧我们有输入
On left side we have inputs

182
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:16,480
在右侧，我们有输出和另一个重要的财产
On the right side we have outputs and another important uproperty

183
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,300
这些套接字没有类型
Those sockets do not have types

184
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,907
因此您可以以任何方式配置笔记并将它们连接到 中
So you can configure the notes and connect them in , in any way

185
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,410
我们有循环的可能性
We have possibility of cycles

186
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,570
这对于页游游戏来说非常重要
And this is quite important in the games , a page game

187
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,490
所以你有很多选择来重复使用对话台词
So you have many options to reuse dialogue lines

188
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,590
而且还可以重用整个任务路径
But also to reuse whole quest paths

189
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,585
嗯，我们有两种类型的节点
Um , we have two types of nodes

190
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:45,030
这是潜在的笔记和即时的笔记
It's latent notes and immediate notes

191
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,655
只要立即执行操作，后面的注释就会保留信号
Latternotes hold the signal as long as operation is executed immediate

192
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:53,490
我们的火燃烧而忘记
Our fire fire and forgot

193
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,762
拉丁音符的附加属性是我们能够保存
Additional properties for the latin notes is that we are able to save

194
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:03,140
呃，到，到，保存他们的进度
Uh , to , to , to save progress of them

195
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,560
并且可以咨询
And can be consult

196
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,340
我们有大量用于不同目的的各种节点
We have plenty of various nodes for different purposes

197
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,890
嗯，但是然后的数量，呃
Um , but amount of then , uh

198
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,490
我们有四个场景的独家注释
We have four exclusive notes for the scenes

199
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,830
首先，重要的节点是节
First , important node is a section

200
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,047
哪个是时间线持有者
And which is timeline holder

201
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:26,380
第二个是一个选择
Second one is a choice

202
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,760
用于对话分支
Which is used to dialogue branching

203
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,740
我们还有两个额外的具体说明
We have two additional specific notes

204
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,990
但我不会报道它们
But i will be not covering them

205
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,020
嗯，深入了解这个演示
Um , deep in this presentation

206
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,450
这个节点控制 stin 的行为方式
And this node control how the stin should behave

207
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,480
如果出现不可接受的蒸汽进展条件
In case of unaccepted conditions for steam progression

208
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,220
例如，玩家正在退出达里亚或蒸汽
Like for example player is exiting the daria or the steam is

209
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,840
或者例如枪战开始
Or for example the gun fight start

210
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,620
第二个是可重新执行部分，它是该部分的扩展版本
And second one is reendable section it's extended version of the section

211
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,292
具有向后播放的能力
With the ability to play backwards

212
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:12,360
嗯，还有一些额外的选项可以直接从播放器控制
Um , also have some additional options to control directly from the player

213
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,240
我们在赛博朋克品牌中使用它
We are using it in cyber punk brand ances

214
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,280
部分是专门说明嗯
Section is a note specifically dedicate that um

215
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,420
在图表上创建时间同步序列
To create time synchronized sequences on the graph

216
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,860
在这里你可以看到其中三个
Here you can see three of them

217
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,320
正如您所看到的，它们以非常不同的配置连接
They are , as you see connected in very different configuration

218
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,080
该部分还有哪些内容
What else about the section

219
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,800
章节注释有自己的时间表
Section note have their own timeline

220
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,380
这让设计在低层次上控制正在发生的事情
Which give um design at low level control over what's happening

221
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,815
该团队嗯时间线包含时间地点事件
This team um timeline contains time place events

222
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:58,190
其中一些有持续时间，例如动画或对话台词
Some of which have duration like animation or dialogue lines

223
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,310
其他只是点事件，例如视觉特效是 lucuts
Other are just point events like vfx is lucuts

224
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,180
时间轴将这些事件存储在轨道上
Timeline stores those events on tracks

225
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,380
你可以在左边看到它突出显示了我们的足迹
And here you see on the left it's highlighted our tracks

226
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,380
为了表明进展，我们有两件事
And to indicate the progress we have two things

227
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,320
一个是播放头
One is playhead

228
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,260
它被标记在轨道旁边
it's marked next to the tracks

229
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,540
并在右上角的计时器处
and on the right top corner at timer

230
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,062
您还可以在其中看到这方面的进展
Where you also can see the the progression of this s

231
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:34,670
在最右边你可以看到屏幕播放
On the far right you can see screen play

232
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:41,637
Po屏剧是对话视角的剖面图
Po screen play is a section view for dialogue perspective

233
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:43,150
用户界面
Ui

234
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:50,060
您也可以考虑作为作者的数据的欧盟视图
Also you can consider in as eu view of the data for the writer

235
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,512
所以我们支持很多这样的事情，这取决于工作

236
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:56,770
数据时间的视图不同
The view of data time is be different

237
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,660

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,102
syneitor是如何构建的
How syneitor is constructed

239
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:09,380
我认为是时候看看它能做什么了
I think that it's time to see what it can do

240
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,780
我们将完成创建蒸汽基本结构的过程
We will go through the process of creating basic structure of the steam

241
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:20,600
而且，呃，我想重建数码公园现有场景的一部分
And , uh , i want to reconstruct part of existing scene from cyber park

242
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,500
但别担心，呃

305
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,410
它是根据文本本身计算的
It's calculated based on text itself

306
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:25,760
然后从自动生成的画外音中获取长度
Then the length is taken from automatically generated voiceovers

307
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,440
最后是由专业演员录制的记录
And finally from the records recorded but by professional actors

308
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,570
第二个注意点，对于 disets 来说很重要的是选择节点

309
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,110
选择笔记有对话选项
Choice notes have dialogue options

310
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,120
就像各个地区都有不同的气候一样
Just like sections have a dioc climes

311
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,487
对话选项，嗯，也在屏幕播放中创建
Dialogue options , um , are also creating in the screen play

312
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:49,760
国王创建对话选项后

313
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,300
并且新的套接字出现在选择上
And new socket appears on the choice

314
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,100
在这里你可以看到
Here you can see

315
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,620
我知道这不是很清楚
I know that it's not not very clear

316
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,240
但有两个插座
But there is two sockets

317
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,322
因为我们在这里有两个选择
because we here we have two choice options

318
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:05,750
一个连接到一个并注意这个红色的
And one is connected to the one and note to this red one

319
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,850
第二个是这个蓝色并注意

328
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:50,520
可以在生成的画外音之上生成 Net 和 liping
Net and liping can be generated on top of those generated voiceovers

329
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,830
这两个进程都是离线的
Both of those processes are offline

330
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,910
在我们的，嗯，基础设施服务的帮助下实现这一点
Implement that with help of our , um , infrastructure services

331
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,930
所以在这个视频中，嗯
So on this video , um

332
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,050
你会看到我正在开始预览
And you'll see that i'm starting the preview

333
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,090
感人的戏剧和后果
The play that is moving and consequence

334
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,980
一
Um

335
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,100
对话活动围绕
Dialogue events are around

336
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,970
你会看到对话线出现在部分之后
And you see the dialogue lines appearing after section

337
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,070
信号将到达选择节点
And the signal is going to the choice node

338
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,210
五秒后自动
And after five seconds automatically

339
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,010
而选择就是说话
And the choice is speak

340
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,710
信号向右并注意
And the signal goes to the right and note

341
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,880
而且，呃，现在我们已经掌握了所有基础知识
And , uh , now we have all basics

342
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,180
这样我就可以去，呃
So i can go to , uh

343
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,940
实施的第一个描述和
First description of implementation and

344
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,250
这将是信号分配机制
And it will be signal distribution mechanism

345
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,100
我将在这些演示图中使用，呃
I'll be using , uh , in these presentation diagrams

346
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,650
呃，有，而不是，呃，纯代码
Uh , of there instead of , uh , pure code

347
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,280
一
Um

348
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,830
所以这里的条件
So here the condition

349
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,690
大部分煤炭都在这个由点组成的角中
large part and large part of coals are in this raq angles made from dots

350
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,350
用作由破折号组成的三个缠结
Function as three tangles made from the dashes

351
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,250
信号分配从看到状态开始
Signal distribution is started from seeing state

352
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,220
在见过的实例中调用 run
Called run in seen instances

353
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,520
一般来说有很多状态并且不断变化
In general of have many states and changing

354
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,777
但这里将重点关注状态内存
But here will be focused on on state ram

355
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:25,670
所以，呃，像其他国家一样管理国家
So , uh , state run like others

356
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,910
呃，状态得到，嗯
Uh , states gets , um

357
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,530
呃，来自引擎的浮点增量时间
Uh , floating point delta time from the engine

358
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:36,345
增量时间用于增加我们的内部场景时钟
Delta time is used to increment our internal scenclock

359
00:25:36,345 --> 00:25:40,170
我们的内部蒸汽钟信誉不佳
Our internal steam clock is discredit

360
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:47,222
用于简单比较和计算的固定点值（以毫秒为单位）
Fixed point value in milliseconds for trivial comparation and calculations

361
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:54,545
然后 Sin 时钟转换为时间窗口并传递给处理 token 函数
Sin clock then is convert to the time window and pass to process token function

362
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:57,990
嗯，执行信号分配的地方
Um , where the signal distribution is perform

363
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,520
关于老年人的一些有趣的事实
Some interesting facts about the senistances

364
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,630
在网络朋克中
And in cyber pank

365
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:09,202
我们可以同时拥有多达 200 个活动皮肤实例
We can have up to two hundred active skin instances at once

366
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:15,400
游戏中的 auston 实例最多可以消耗一毫秒
Which can consume maximum one milliseconds for auston instances on the game

367
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,050
适用于任何平台的线程
Thread for any platform

368
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,990
它包括，呃，所有的js
It includes , uh , all the js

369
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:26,130
并且我们已经对待与外部系统的安全通信
And we have treat safe communication with external systems

370
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,030
给我们一些灵活性也是如此
So is giving us some flexibility

371
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,920
当我们想要时，运行我们的更新
When we want to , to run our updates

372
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,700
基于代币概念的信号分配
Signal distribution in based on token concept

373
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,900
嗯，我们使用令牌的主要假设是能够更新整个图
Um , the main assumption we use tokens was to be able to update an entireon graph

374
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,007
但也有选择性地，嗯
But selectively also to , um

375
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:54,790
能够传播时间预算
Be able to propagate time budget

376
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,510
预算与信号一起
Budgets together with the signal

377
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,502
拥有那个位置也非常重要
And also very important to have that locality

378
00:27:01,502 --> 00:27:04,000
在这里我们可以看到，嗯
Here we can see the , um

379
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,500
简化的主循环，呃
The simplifying main loop , uh

380
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,040
使用代币安装草的信号有哪些进展
Which progress the signal instsing grass with using tokens

381
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,470
所以在运行之前
So before it's run

382
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,350
立场场景如何开始，因为它已创建
How the scene in stance can start because it's created

383
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,870
然后我们在纸条上放置信号令牌
And then what we are putting signal token on the note

384
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,090
大多数情况下是开始，呃
In most cases is start , uh

385
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,975
现场注意事项
Note of the scene

386
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:30,550
在节点上放置信号意味着什么
And what means put signal on the node

387
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,397
这意味着我们正在创建信号令牌对象
It means that we are creating signal token object

388
00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:37,240
分配给它的节点id
Assigned to it node id

389
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,380
并将其添加到 ri 中，呃
And add it to the ri , uh

390
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,410
过程中第一个操作就是我们是,嗯
First operation during the the process is that we are , um

391
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,790
将非活动令牌更改为活动令牌
Changing inactive tokento active

392
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:55,450
如果我们可以将这些不活动标记的目的放在帧之间
If we can purpose of those inactive tokens is to leave between frames

393
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,315
并且能够控制时间预算
And to be able to control time budgets

394
00:27:58,315 --> 00:27:59,090
呃
Uh

395
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,790
所以一个好的例子是
So the good example would be that for example

396
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,230
你不想在这个特定的框架中执行一些节点
You don't want in this particular frame , execute some node

397
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,980
但你想进入，呃，另一个框架
But you want to in , uh , another frame

398
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,722
那么你就将不活动而不是活动
So then you are putting inactive instead of active

399
00:28:13,722 --> 00:28:15,710
状态令牌 信号令牌
State token signal token

400
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,360
对不起
Sorry

401
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,867
信号令牌注释的一部分，嗯
A part of signal token notes , um

402
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:23,752
注意可以生成e
Note can generate e

403
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:26,050
执行令牌，呃
Execution token , uh

404
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:31,445
这允许注释在外部系统上执行
Which gave permission for the note for execution on the external systems

405
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:36,170
并且不处理也可以生成状态令牌来感知笔记
And also not processing can generate state token to perceive notes

406
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:40,035
帧之间或游戏会话之间的状态
State between frames or between game sessions

407
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:44,650
所以token是在节点进程中生成的
So tokens are generated during node process

408
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,870
嗯，我们正在循环，呃
Um , we are looping , uh

409
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:54,430
执行信号分配循环，直到我们有活跃令牌为止
The loop of signal distribution is executed until we have active tokens

410
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,360
所以直到我们的 ri 中有活跃代币
So until we have in our ri active tokens

411
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,990
我们正在循环，循环
We are looping , looping

412
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,550
循环播放。当它是空的时候
Looping . when it's empty

413
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,940
我们可以拿另一件事为例并做同样的事情
We can take another thing instance and do the same

414
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:11,892
或者说，它是我们所有系统和处理的结束
Or the , its end of all of our system and processing

415
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:16,070
关于代币的有趣事实是我们使用，嗯
Interesting facts about the tokens is that we use , um

416
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,070
令牌的一种尺寸
One size for the tokens

417
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,265
所以我们可以将它们存储在ri中
So we can store them in the ri

418
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:24,460
我非常擅长
And i are very good for

419
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:31,580
嗯，因为内存局部性和图状态独立于
Um , for memory locality and graph state is independent from the

420
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,910
呃，图表数据
Uh , graph data

421
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,340
所以我们可以进行不同的优化
So we can optimize differently

422
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,250
状态记忆
The memory for the state

423
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,530
对于数据则不同
And differently for , for the data

424
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,740
所以考虑到所有这些
So taking all of that

425
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,700
我们可以减少运行时的内存池
We could reduce the memory pool for the runtime

426
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,460
Sing data , um , to , 兆字节
Sing data , um , to , for mega bytes

427
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,300
对于这么大的游戏来说这已经相当不错了
Which is quite good for such a big game

428
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:01,160
我们已经有了，呃，基本结构，通常由任务设计师在制作中完成
We already have , uh , basic structure which would be done by the quest designer normally in the production

429
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,340
现在我们去舞台吧，呃
Now let's go to the staging , uh

430
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,380
这是由电影设计师完成的
Which is done by the cinematic designer

431
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,850
我想要的前几个术语，你知道什么是分期
First few terms which i want to , you know what is staging

432
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:18,970
这就是演员我们的舞台或放置在这个 stm 上来引导玩家的方式
This is how actor our stage or placed at this stm to guide player

433
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,250
并获得最佳可能的图像质量
And get the best possibility image quality

434
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:26,420
是啊，为了，为了拥有完美的构图
Yeah , to , to have perfect composition

435
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,985
乙
E

436
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:33,490
您可以将其视为关键职位的作品可以理解为动画
Work you can considering as a key post can be understand as animation

437
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,445
其中不包含很多运动
Which do not contains a lot of motion

438
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:41,475
呃，在舞台定义的某个位置上
Uh , at its place in some position defined by the staging

439
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:43,380
呃，工作运动
Uh , worksports

440
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,310
这是工作资源的简称
This is short name for the work resource

441
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,010
呃，为了工作资源
Uh , for the work resource

442
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,870
作品之间的动画
Animation between works

443
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:56,570
我将称之为过渡和作品，过渡将是
I will be calling transitions and works and transition will be

444
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,162
呃，把一些事件放在时间线上
Uh , placing on timeline as some events

445
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:03,810
那么让我们开始构建吧
So let's go and let's start building the

446
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,770
分期并完成分期过程
The staging and go through the staging process

447
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,220
首先在我们需要打开的部分
First in the section we need to turn on

448
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,987
将时间线轨道专用于夹克
Dedicate the timeline track for a jacke

449
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:21,830
你还会看到不仅有一个轨道还有很多子轨道
you will see also that there are not only one track but many subtracks

450
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,660
这是布局的默认行，可以扩展
And this is default line of layout which can be extended

451
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:32,960
专用轨道，嗯用于组织活动和设置参考
dedicated track , um is for organizing events and out to set references

452
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,200
我们有，嗯，专用轨道
We have , um , dedicated track

453
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,970
现在我将添加更改工作事件
And now i will add change work event

454
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,860
而这次活动专门设置了一个作品
And this event is dedicated to set a work

455
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,530
设置的参数是目标
Parameters to set are the target

456
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,915
所以在我们的例子中它将是 jackie mtt
So in our case it will be jackie mtt

457
00:31:51,915 --> 00:31:55,620
第二个参数是，呃，工作
And second parameter is , uh , work

458
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,820
我会记录一下作品是动画
I will record that work is an animation

459
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:05,100
或在团队中具有一定位置的简单帖子来选择单词
or simple post with certain placement in a team to select word

460
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,465
我正在使用单词选择器
I'm using word picker

461
00:32:07,465 --> 00:32:11,860
我会把座位安排到需要工作的地方
And i will set seat to hands on nees work

462
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,975
这这这就是这部作品的名字
This , this will be the , the name of this work

463
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,980
正如你所看到的，我们可以有很好的背景
And as you see what we can have nice context

464
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,447
搜索哪个过滤掉，呃，工作体育图书馆
Search which filter out , uh , worksports library

465
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:29,070
我们对目标实体进行了使用寿命预览
And we have useful life preview with target entity

466
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,940
关于workspuh work picer 本身
About workspuh work picer itself

467
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,960
它正在使用工作簿库
It's using workbook librari

468
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,320
哪一组工作导出按命名约定按类别排序
Which is set of work exports sorted in categories with naming convention

469
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,290
允许快速搜索锻炼库
Which allowing quick search workout library

470
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,197
您可以将其想象为包含工作资源的文件夹的地图视图
You can imagine as map view of folders with work resources

471
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:55,540
呃，我在这里展示了两个通用配置的作品
Uh , i'm showing here two works in common configuration

472
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:01,690
呃，除了闲置动画之外还添加了其他内容
Uh , where additional were addition to the idle animation

473
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:07,075
具有附加动画以随机方式播放
Has additive animation to played in sell the random manner

474
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:13,382
其目的是增加本能中看到的动画的多样性
The purpose of it is to increase variety of animations seen in instincts

475
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:19,350
而且它也让游戏变得更加有趣，对于玩家来说
And also it makes it led more interesting for , for the player

476
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,660
好的
Okay

477
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,170
所以我们，呃，安排工作
So we have , uh , set work

478
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,707
嗯，我要开始预览了
Um , i will start the preview

479
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:36,130
可以看到jackie立马把默认的作品改了
You can see that the jackie immediately changed the work from the default

480
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,640
从活动开始工作
Work to work from the event

481
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,470
呃，这个大招有效
Uh , and this ult work

482
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,562
我们去偶像摊
We are going idol stand

483
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:49,757
呃，尽管事实上这是一个循环执行动画的点事件夹克
Uh , despite the fact that it's a point event jacket performed animation in loop

484
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:52,730
作品不是单一的动画
Work is not a single animation

485
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,830
它是实体的整个逻辑ai状态
It is whole logical ai state of entity

486
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,900
现在是转场，呃，让我们看看进一步添加作品和转场的过程
Now transitions , uh , so let's look at the further process of adding works and transitions

487
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,489
我添加另一个变更工作事件
I add another change work event

488
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:18,310
这次我卖的是一只鹿自动转出
And this time i'm selling transition a deer automatically deout

489
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,459
之前是什么姿势
What pose was before

490
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,239
一
Um

491
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,040
并在选择后建议匹配的转换，嗯
And suggest the transition that matches , um , after selecting

492
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,870
还注意到工作也出来了选择这个能力来扣除
also noted that work is also also out to selected this ability to deduct

493
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,350
演员在某个时刻之前的状态是什么
What the state of the actor is before certain moment

494
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,159
结合适当的命名约定
Combined with proper naming convention

495
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,330
这对设计师来说是一个很大的速度笑话
It's a big speed gag for designer

496
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,860
等等 。最重要的是
And so on . top of that

497
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,980
如果您可以从看到图表的任何时刻开始预览
If you can start preview from any moment of seeing graph

498
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:53,989
然后你将拥有非常好的快速实现和迭代循环
Then you will have really nice fast implementation and iteration loop

499
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,000
我们无力记录
We cannot afford to record

500
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,470
作品之间所有过渡组合的所有动画
All animations for all combination of transitions between works

501
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,570
这只是物理上不可能的
It's just physically not possible

502
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,972
我们没有，我们没有这方面的预算
And we don't have we didn't have budgets for for that

503
00:35:14,972 --> 00:35:17,100
所以下一个三节课
So next tris session

504
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,480
我需要选择手动盟友
I need to select manual ally

505
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,840
我在工作中关掉过滤器
I turn off the filter in work

506
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:29,555
呃，选择器和，呃，设置为最适合我的场景的过渡
Uh , picker and , uh , set for the best fitting transition to my scene

507
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:36,680
预记录转换和一般记录之间的平衡处于我们正在飙升的位置
These balance between pre records transitions and general ones is placed where we are surging

508
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,760
削减生产成本
Cut of production costs

509
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,290
好的，我们已经有了所有的姿势
Okay , so we have all poses

510
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,910
让我们看看皮肤是什么样子的
Let's see how the skin looks like

511
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:55,430
与上一届会议的结构工作和过渡
With the structure works and transitions in previous session

512
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,500
再次
Again

513
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,400
我们开始预览
We starting the preview

514
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,350
你会看到类似的
You will see that similar

515
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,610
我喜欢上一个视频
I like on the previous video

516
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:12,480
呃，我们正在移动播放头，对话台词出现了
Uh , we are moving the the playhead and the dialogue lines appeared

517
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,760
但也运行相应的转换
But also the corresponding transitions are run

518
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,060
杰基也在改变中间的姿势
And jackie is changing also the the poses in between

519
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,690
因此，放置在该场景中或该场景的一部分的可能性非常重要
So this is very important that this possibility to place in or part of this scene

520
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,015
刚换完后
Just after changing

521
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:34,550
对场景进行更改极大地缩短了实施时间
Make the changes to the scene is extreme boost in implementation time

522
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:40,420
现在我们准备进行第二次实现
So now we are ready to go to the second implementation

523
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,382
我想展示的是事件处理和执行
Which i want to show is events processing and execution

524
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:48,330
我们已经知道发生了什么
We already know what are the events

525
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,200
以及它们在编辑器中的位置
And where they are in editor

526
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,390
在内部，时间线轨道不存在
Internally , timeline track do not exist

527
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,660
但我把它们放在这里是为了更方便
But i keep them here for easier

528
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,870
了解活动的概念和实施
Understanding of the concept and implementation of the events

529
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,110
包含 id 、开始时间
Contains id , start time

530
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:08,950
水龙头类型和 partype 专用参数
Tap type and partype dedicated parameters

531
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:17,835
呃，在过程部分中，像任何其他部分一样获得时间预算
During uh , section process section gets time budget like any and out

532
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:22,390
而这个预算就转化为时间窗口
And this budget is transformed into time window

533
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:28,290
哪一个和这里左边的两个重要属性是包容性的
Which and here two important properties on left is inclusive

534
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,895
右侧不包含在内
On the right side is not inclusive

535
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:36,700
时间窗口之外的内容是执行的
What is outside of the time window was execute that

536
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,702
或将在未来被处决
Or will be executed in the future

537
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:45,540
但是我们对包容性和包容性网站的理解是，嗯
But what we understand by inclusive and ninclusive sites of the , um

538
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,170
时间窗口在这里
Time window here

539
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,880
你可以在幻灯片上看到，呃，这一事件
You can see , uh , on the slide that one event

540
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,290
开始时间到了。它等于时间窗口的开始时间
It start time . it's equal to the start time of the time window

541
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:03,142
在这个框架中我们将执行这个 um 事件
And in this frame we will execute this um event

542
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:06,500
但我们还有第二个活动
but we have also second an event

543
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,050
本次活动具体开始时间
Which start time of this event

544
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:15,200
在这些人中，点事件等于时间窗口的结束事件
Point event is equal to end event of time window in such guys

545
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,700
该帧中的该事件不会被执行
This event in this frame will be not executed

546
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,060
并且会在下一帧执行
And it will be executed in the next frame

547
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,240
偶数处理从确定偶数的位置开始
The even processing begins with determining the position of the

548
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,930
呃，呃，当然事件过程，呃
Uh , uh , course event course of , uh

549
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,550
基于时间窗口
Based on time window

550
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,570
然后我们迭代事件直到到达事件
And then we iterate through events until we get to the event

551
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,750
哪个不包含在时间窗口内
Which is not contained by the time window

552
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,650
这不是重叠
It's not overlap

553
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,030
一
Um

554
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,967
我们创建动作部分
We creating action parts

555
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:50,137
在处理当前有关动作部分的事件期间
During this processing of events about action parts in the moment

556
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:53,250
现在，让我们集中精力，呃
For now , let's focus that , uh

557
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:59,062
我们可以根据事件的活动生成不同的动作部分
We can generate different action parts depending on activity of the event

558
00:38:59,062 --> 00:39:02,020
而且，那就是，嗯
And , and that's , um

559
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,880
该活动的活动，呃，是
Activity , uh , of the event is

560
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,840
确定时间窗口如何与事件重叠
Determine how , uh , time window overlap the event

561
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,530
如果时间窗口包含事件的开始，则开始活动
And if the time window contains the beginning of the event , it start activity

562
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,390
如果窗口与事件的中间部分重叠
If the window overlap the middle part of the event

563
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,350
然后是常规活动
Then its regular activity

564
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:25,070
如果末端被覆盖，它的和活动
And if the end is covered , its and activity

565
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,560
evin的各个动作部分按动作键排列
the evin individual action parts are arranged by action key

566
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,280
排序后，动作部分将按类型分组
in such a way that after sorting the action parts will be grouped by the type

567
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,940
并且将执行具有最高属性的动作部分
And action part with the highest perty will be performed

568
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:50,780
第一个组合器是用于对类型中的操作部分进行排序的附加参数
First combiner is additional parameter to sort action part within a type

569
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:56,390
因此，组合错误可以例如将执行的目标 id
so combine error can for example target id on which will perform

570
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:04,730
所以我们可以，例如，首先为第一个mtt做动作部分
So we can , for example , first do action part for first mtt

571
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,410
然后是第二个和第三个
Then for the second and the thir

572
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,960
我认为现在是扩展的好时机
i think that is a good moment to expand

573
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,280
为什么我们要创建这些动作和动作部分
Why we are creating those actions and action parts

574
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,437
并且不直接对事件执行
And not executing directly on the from the events

575
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:22,790
应考虑速度来优化执行过程
Execution process should be optimized with taking into into account speed

576
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,950
依赖性
Dependency

577
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,057
解析和外部系统特性
Resolving and external system characteristics

578
00:40:28,057 --> 00:40:29,870
为了满足这些要求
To meet those requirements

579
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,010
我们使用，嗯，动作
We use , um , actions

580
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:36,157
这给了我们独立的分离和灵活性
Which give us separate separation and flexibility

581
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:40,930
与事件相反，动作和动作部分是在 rin time 中创建的
Action and action parts , in contrast to events are created in rin time

582
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,950
具有良好的分拣能力
Have good sorting capabilities

583
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,390
因为他们是在运行时创建的
And because they are creating in runtime

584
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:49,760
我们关于 stm 实例内的依赖关系吗
Are our about dependences within stm instances

585
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,410
好的
Okay

586
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,650
所以我们通过处理部分
So we pass the the part with the processing

587
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,630
现在执行并执行操作
Now execution and the execution of the operation

588
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,310
首先根据操作键对操作路径进行排序
Begin with the sorting of action paths based on action keys

589
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:05,720
我们在上一张幻灯片中讨论的内容
Those which we are talking about on the previous slide

590
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,990
然后将动作部分添加到动作中
Then the action parts are added to the action

591
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:15,950
动作和动作部分之间的关​​系是动作包含执行代码
A rela relationship between action and action part is that action contains execution code

592
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,905
使用动作部分作为参数
Which use action parts as a parameters

593
00:41:19,905 --> 00:41:24,040
最后，呃，动作被执行了
Finally , the actions , uh , are performed

594
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,535
执行时可能会导致
Which may result as execution

595
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:29,440
嗯，外部系统或作曲家

作曲家是，嗯，模特

597
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:39,257
负责同一目标上不同tm实例之间的分发操作

598
00:41:39,257 --> 00:41:40,920
例如，一个
For example , um

599
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,660
如果你想
If you want

600
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,420
如果同时运行几个场景
If you have few scenes running at the same time

601
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,540
他们正在访问玩家
And they are accessing player

602
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:54,667
所以我们需要一些层来检测冲突或
So we need some layer which will be detecting the conflicts or

603
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:57,030
或者决定应该先做什么
Or deciding what should be first

604
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,880
其次应该是什么
And what should be second

605
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,420
最后，我想向您展示预览会话是如何进行的
At the end , i want to show you how the preview session

606
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,470
呃，按比例工作
Uh , works in the scale

607
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,140
一
Um

608
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,400
我将运行
And i will run the

609
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,782
前一届最终版场景加载了夜城视频
The previous session of the final version of the scene with night city loaded videos

610
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:18,490
口型同步和后期处理
Lip sync and post processes

611
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,670
嗯，我知道也许你不在这里溜冰场
Um , i know that maybe you are not here rink

612
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,950
声音，嗯

但抱歉，我现在不会修复
But sorry that i , i will not fix right now

614
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,250
但您会看到比预览更多的内容
But you will see much more than on the preview

615
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,210
预览，预览会议肯定
Preview , preview session for sure

616
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:04,700
所以它看起来与你在游戏中看到的非常相似
so it looks pretty identical to what you see in game

617
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,120
是的，所以你可以改变相机的姿势
Yeah , so you can pose change the camera

618
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,020
是的
Yeah

619
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,480
玩家没有经历过这很有趣
player do not have had it's pretty funny

620
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,360
是的，我们可以回到fpp来吧

00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:56,800
好的

你知道第一人称视角是，呃
And you know that first person perspective was , uh

625
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:11,247
当我们设计和实现工具集中的许多东西时，这是一个重要的部分
Important part when we are designing and implementation and implementing many things in the toolset

626
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:19,050
而且你知道，男女主角不仅仅是游戏设置统计中的参数
And you know that female and male protagonist is not just parameter in the game setting statistics

627
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:24,380
这是创建呃场景系统时的重要特征

我给你看了 sca itor

我在实践中使用场景结构和场景分期

我们完成了信号分配

631
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:40,297
其中使用了代币并了解其工作原理以及是什么
Which used tokens and learn how it works and what is

632
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:43,260
这是相当简单的实现
And that is quite light implementation

633
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,240
在最后
At the end

634
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,390
我们使用动作来分解执行过程
We decompose even execution process with use of actions

635
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,940
