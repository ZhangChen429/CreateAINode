1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,020
大家早上好
So good morning everyone

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,232
我叫斯普辛斯基
my name is sputshinski

3
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:11,110
我欢迎您参加
and i would like to welcome you on the presentation of the

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,790
这是一个免费的电影对话系统
Which is a free cinematic dialogue system

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,260
我提到过请了一位导演，那是遗憾的
i i mentioned taking a director that's the regret

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,680
歌词大意： 在我另一个的日子里
And on my other's day

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,960
我在引擎内部编写代码开发
I write code developing our in house at engine

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,710
如您所见，在过去
as you can see , in the past

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,870
我当时正在制作《巫师》游戏
i was working on the witcher games years

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,910
目前正在开发一款新游戏
And currently working on a new game

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,110
海豹磅二十七十七
Seal pound twenty seventy seven

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,580
好
Okay

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,980
首先，我想向大家展示我们在程序员中的精彩对话
First i'd like to show you our awesome dialogue in programmers

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,142
动画师 qa 和 anuh 以及程序员和设计师
Animators qa and anuh and programmers and designers

15
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:48,250
因为我今天要给大家看的一切
because everything i'm going to show you today

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,230
是结果将如何来和工作
Is the result of how will come and work

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,650
对于那些没有玩过的人来说，这些是免费的
And for those of you who have not played the which are free

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,130
让他与游戏一起成为英国人
Let him british with the game

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,290
我将谈论
I will be talking about

20
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,000
好
Okay

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,630
那么什么是微信
So what is the wechat

22
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,220
这是一款开放世界角色扮演游戏，没有最后的商店
which is an open world rpg with no one last store

23
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,300
正如今天所说的 elemment 一样
As it's called elemment for today

24
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,930
播放 correstories 、a kk 和一切
Play correstories , a kk and everything

25
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,945
每个游戏系统都是围绕这个原则构建的
every game system is built around this principle

26
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:21,170
或者向玩家传达故事的主要工具是对话
Or the main tool for communicating story to players is dialogue

27
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,420
因为对话可以让我们向玩家展示选择
<span style="color: red;">让我们向玩家展示选择</span>
Because dialogue allow us to present choices to players

28
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,660
然而，提出一个有意义的选择要困难得多
<span style="color: red;">为什么是提出一个选择是困难的</span>
however it's much harder to present a meaningful choice

29
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,530
使用 oniggamplay，这就是电影对话成为关键词的原因
Using oniggamplay that's the reason why cinematic dialogue was a keyword for u

30
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,360
做出有意义的选择
To make a meaningful choice

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,435
玩家必须感受到情感依恋
<span style="color: red;">为了做出一个有意义的选择，玩家必须产生情感依赖</span>
Play player must feel an emotional attachment

32
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:39,700
为此
For this to happen

33
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,490
我们需要在游戏角色中建立玩家之间的联系 
<span style="color: red;">建立这种联系需要跟多的交流方式</span>
We need to build the connection between the players at the game characters

34
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,970
建立这种联系可以通过有价值的方式实现，例如加拿大的工作
Building such a connection can be achieved in valuable ways like canada work

35
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,270
面部表情或一般非语言交流
<span style="color: red;">非语言的其他选择交流</span>
Facial expression or general nonverbal communicatio

36
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,100
根据那里的规则对决
According to the rule showdown there

37
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,030
所以简单的手势和衣服都可以告诉你
So simple gesture and clothes up can tell u

38
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,110
不止多行对话
More than many lines of the dialogue

39
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,280
好
Okay

40
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,330
因此，如果电影内容对我们来说如此重要
<span style="color: red;">为了创造更丰富的非语言表现的联系和选择？于是选择了使用更丰富的电影内容？去表达吗？</span>
So if cinematic content is so important for us

41
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,140
我。仪表可以创建每一个对话，对吧
I . meters can create every single dialogue , right

42
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,195
不幸的是，这是不可能的
<span style="color: red;">开发商角度上看不可能每一个对话都去创造艺术的对话Section</span>
Unfortunately , it wouldn't be possible

43
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:13,660
我们必须创造，呃
We had to create over , uh

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,800
三十五小时，呃，cinematic 内容
<span style="color: red;">开发过程不可能针对每一段Section创建内容</span>
Thirty five hours of , uh ,cinematic content

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,590
所以我们需要一支狂热的军队
So we would require an army of fanimato

46
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,870
我们根本没有
we simply didn't have

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,580
此外，Section Cut 的生产成本很高
<span style="color: red;">Section cuttin生产成本很高</span>
Additionally , cutting are expensive to produce

48
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,740
每次切割都需要受过良好教育的 mocup sessio
Every cutting requires a educated mocup sessio

49
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,760
还有多天的动画师工作
And many days of animator work

50
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,530
如图所示
As you can see on the picture

51
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,790
你必须创建超过一千四百个对话
You had to create over fourteen hundred dialogues

52
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,847
所以对于一个小团队来说，这是一个疯狂的数字
So it's insane number for a small team

53
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:41,020
那么解决方案是什么
So what was the solution

54
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:47,140
实施的解决方案是一个对话系统，它允许我们创建电影场景
<span style="color: red;">对话内容是一个整套的系统</span>
The solution implemented was a dialogue system that allowed us to create cinematic conten

55
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,260
使用预先制作的资产创建电影内容，通过创建一些合法的榫展示象征的意义
<span style="color: red;">合法的榫会是什么，我们的榫应该是什么样的？榫的核心目标是批量化生产出可以建立玩家与游戏角色的联系上的情感感觉吗？展示的象征意义是什么？</span>
Using only primate assets like building something of leggo beks

56
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,747
我将向您展示一个简单的示例
I will show you on the simple example

57
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,290
所以一侧你可以看到一个custo
So the one side you can see a custo

58
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,670
每次切割都是从 MCUP 会议开始的
every cutting started as a mcup session

59
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,110
简单地说，一个 catheme 需要一次 mocup 会话
And simply speaking one catheme takes one mocup session

60
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,522
另一方面，Dalloon 是由通用部件制成的
Dalloon other hand are made from generic pieces

61
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:10,590
因此，从同一组构建块中，我们可以创建许多对话
So from the same set of building blocks we can create many dialogues

62
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,790
而这才是关键
And this is the key

63
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,940
这种方法要好得多
this approach is case much better

64
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,630
而且它具有成本效益
And it's cost effective

65
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,279
当然，还值得一提的是
of course it's also worth to mention that

66
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,131
当您已经完成所有这些灵长类动物资产时
When you have all these primate assets already done

67
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,830
每个人都可以创建对话
Everyone can create a dialogue

68
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,590
你不需要知道我的情感生成器或马
You don't need to know that my emotion builder or ma

69
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,400
您可以打开少量或创建资产
You can open little or and create asset

70
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,630
甚至我没有远距离
And even i without an distmatic

71
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,130
但地面几乎造就了所有的例子
But the ground made all almost all examples

72
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,570
您将看到此演示文稿
You will see this presentation

73
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,410
好吧，把分类习俗搞砸了
Okay , frapping up classing customs

74
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,870
动画师的经典剪辑可能是我们可以在对话中使用的构建块之一
Classic cutting may by animator is one of our building block that we can use in the dialogue

75
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,300
通常 ktine 在独特的
and usually ktine was necessary in unique

76
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,870
否则很难仅使用通用部分的场景
Scenarios that otherwise would be hard to be using only generic pieces

77
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,840
所以视频块的切割看起来更像这样
So cuts in viding blocks looks more like this

78
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,660
就像一件适合特殊情况的独特作品
Like a unique piece for special situation

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,340
在开发之初
At the beginning of the development

80
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,575
我们有一个对话系统，用于未来的两个
We had a dialogue system for the future two

81
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,980
这相当简单
It was rather simple

82
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,630
就像一动不动的角色，具有完整的消化或理想的动画
Like motionless characters with a full bodigesture or ideal animation

83
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,745
摄像机运动仅限于简单的剪辑
The camera movement was limited to simple cuts

84
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:19,850
当你把它和海关比较时
When you compare it to the customs

85
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,620
大羚羊的活力较差，质量较低
dallocks were less dynamic and lower quality

86
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,070
为了未来免费
For the future free

87
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,810
你想对话有同样的感觉，头上的切口
You want to dialogue to have the same feeling , the cuts in head

88
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,570
质量相同
The same amount of quality

89
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,530
等量的抛光
The same amount of polish

90
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,010
因此，首先让我们看看我们的最终结果是什么样子的
So first let's see how our our final result looks like

91
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,567
现在，为我们的特别客人提供特别的款待
And now a special treat for our special guest

92
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:27,010
猎魔人杰洛特和他迷人的搭档陈音乐家
The witcher geralt and his enchanting partner chan musicians

93
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,180
给有爱心的cu的可爱的东西
Something lovely for the loving cu

94
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,230
终于有音乐为我们爱的拥抱
At last music for our loving embrace

95
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,690
真是太遗憾了，是时候发现我浪漫的一面了
Come shame it's time i discovered my romantic side

96
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,440
哦，你相当擅长这个
oh you're rather good at this

97
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,800
这个我不怎么辣
这个我不怎么辣

98
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,020
好
Okay

99
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,660
所以总结一下我们的幽灵，用你的脚
So summarize our ghost for the with your feet

100
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,760
我们想创造独特的电影结构
<span style="color: red;">独特的剧情通用的构建块</span>
We wanted to create unique cinematic conten

101
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,340
大规模仅使用通用构建块
Using only generic building blocks on a massive scale

102
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,300
在我只解释所有细节之前
And before i only explain all the details

103
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,740
我想向你展示大图景
I'd like to show you the big picture

104
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,475
如何在游戏构建对话
How the dialogue is placed within the game

105
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,650
所以我们开始恢复 i
So we start to restore i

106
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,700
一旦战斗在分裂成任务
Once the fight in splitting into the quests

107
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,477
每个任务都有其中的一部分
and every quest there's a part of it

108
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:53,912
任务是用我们的 可视化脚本 语言实现的，其中包含许多满足不同需求的节点
Quests are implemented in our vioascriptic language that contains a lot of nodes for different needs

109
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:55,900
其中一个节点是对话
And one of the nodes is a dialogue

110
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,725
请注意，开始对话
Note that starts a dialogue

111
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:04,820
最后，daluate itor 提供了从头到尾处理对话的所有必要工具
And finally , daluate itor provides all necessary tools for working with dialogues from the beginning to the end

112
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,697
最后的门廊
The final porch

113
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:07,350
好
Okay

114
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,587
那么现在我们来谈谈 deta
So now let's talk about deta

115
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:12,200
因为对话系统相当复杂
Because dialog system is quite complex

116
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,200
我想向您展示单一对话的管道
I'd like to show you the the pipeline of single dialogue

117
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,940
所以你可以一步一步地看到它是如何工作的
So you can see how it works step by step

118
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,440
所以我们有作家、任务、对话设计师和后期制作
So we have writers quest dialog designers and post production

119
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,277
所以我们，我们从编剧部门开始
<span style="color: red;">先从编剧开始</span>
So we , we start with the writers department

120
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:33,280
每个对话都会开始一组，文字悄悄地写在我们的模拟游戏中的视觉效果中
Every dialogue start a set , text crept the scream play is written in our visual in our analogue itor

121
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
而在这一点上
And at this point

122
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,275
它分为部分和选择
<span style="color: red;">Section和Choice</span>
It's split into the sections and choices

123
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:41,015
所以我们有一个基本的存储结构作为一个图
So we have the basic storage structure as a graph

124
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:44,300
保持这个，呃，结构井井有条很重要
It's important to keep this , uh , structure organized

125
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,860
因为 deluxin nutral 可能真的很复杂
Because deluxin nutral can be really complicated

126
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,900
所以图图方法非常吓人
So graph graph approach scares very nice

127
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,080
我也以这种方式准备了，呃，任务
I also prepared this way as fast to the , uh , questio

128
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,580
快速设计者定义了感觉，例如何时应该播放对话
Quick designers defined feelings like when the dialogue should be played

129
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,622
演员是谁
Who are the actor

130
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:04,530
以及在什么方面
And in what appreences

131
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,770
最后，对话应该在哪里播放
And finally , where the dialogue should be played

132
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,400
重要的是要说 tha
It's important to say tha

133
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,650
没有一个故事，我们有猎魔人意味着不仅仅是对话
No ina story that we have the witcher means no only a dialogue

134
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,220
如何完成任务设计者负责添加流程条件
How it's done the quest designers are responsible for adding flow conditions

135
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,580
您可以在幻灯片上看到蓝色音符，用于控制信号流通过 、 呃 、 stoograph
The blue notes you can see on the slide that controls the signal flow through the , uh , stoograph

136
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,640
因此，以前的展开决策会影响存储进度
So previous splay decisions have impact on storage progression

137
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,030
同时
And at the same time

138
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,730
对话可以控制游戏
dialogue can control the game

139
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,370
使用跳过点头的 gami 状态
The gami state by using the skip nod

140
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,480
或者通过设置游戏 快速增长的数据库来进行状态控制
<span style="color: red;">通过数据库方式控制游戏和故事</span>
Or by setting the game fg database

141
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,150
因此，游戏和故事之间的交流是双向的
<span style="color: red;">双向交流的数据流</span>
So the communication between the game and the story goes both ways

142
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:46,670
好
Okay

143
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,280
所以一个印刷机设计师正在下载对话
So one press designers are download the dialogue

144
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,057
对话设计师进来
Dialogue designers came in

145
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,200
他们创造了事物的视觉方面
They create a visual side of the things

146
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,540
这是主要部分
And this is the major part

147
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,360
所以仔细看看 .这里发生了什么
So take a closer look . what's happening here

148
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,637
设计师就像电影导演一样
That of designers are like movie directors

149
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:03,660
主要通过时间线
The primary through the timeline

150
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,120
门类似于视频编辑软件
The doorks similarly to vivideo editing software

151
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,740
所以时间线的长度与诗歌的声音息息相关
So the length of the timeline is tied to the voice of verse

152
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,540
泰国举办活动
And thailand holds events

153
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,870
事件表示玩家的作
Events represent actions on the player

154
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,202
还有八重奏物品或灯等等
And octos items or light and so on

155
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,090
而且你有很多活动可以满足不同的需求
And you have a lot of events for different needs

156
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:28,242
更重要的是，事件可以是联合的、插值的、加权的或训练的
<span style="color: red;">什么是可以联合、可以加权、可以插值的</span>
What's more events can be joint , interpolated , weighted or traint

157
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:32,910
因此，它转移到了一个简单的系统，同时它非常灵活
So it transferred to a simple system that at the same time it's quite flexible

158
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,430
所以要百分百清楚
So to make it one hundred percent clear

159
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,880
这是一个简单的例子
That was a simple example

160
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,405
所以在这种情况下，我们可以看到两个字符
so in this case we can see the two characters

161
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:46,500
我们可以添加像
We can add like the simple event like look at

162
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,950
或者我们可以添加像他们一样的持续时间事件，例如
Or we can add like them duration event , for example

163
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,410
乌阿尼马蒂奥
Uanimatio

164
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,330
做吧
Do it

165
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,920
每个事件都可以修改
Every event can be modifie

166
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,100
因此，我们可以更改事件的持续时间
<span style="color: red;">对事件进行加权 </span>
so we can change the duration of the event

167
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,160
所以动画变慢了
so the animation is slowdown

168
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,500
或者你可以鼓掌开始
Or you can clap the beginning

169
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,760
钳制事件的开始
Clamp the beginning of the event

170
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,020
因此，混合因子动画将起到不同的作用
So the blend in factor animation will do different

171
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,200
就像我们可以控制身体动画一样
The same way we can control the the body animation

172
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,080
我们可以控制面部动画
we can control the facial animations

173
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,200
或者任何物体，在任何时间都可以在dialoa细节中删除
Or any object and in any time can be removed in dialoa detail

174
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,280
假设你想把它移开一点
So let's say you would like to move it get out a little bit

175
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,000
正如我提到的，我们可以插值事件
As i mentioned we can interpolate the event

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,460
因此，让我们为这种情况做这个
So let's do this for this case

177
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,300
你有那个超级简单的动画
and you have that super simple animation

178
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,260
好吧，Cinmatic内容必须依存于世界
Okay , symatic content demands that the stin has to be granted the game world

179
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,200
因此，由于这种对话，设计师希望了解周围的对话环境
<span style="color: red;">对话内容是依存于环境的</span>
So because of this dialogue designers wanted to be aware of the dialogue surroundings

180
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,520
所以你添加了可以添加对话的功能
so you added feature that you can add dialogue

181
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,280
不仅在空的和对话预览中，您还可以在幻灯片上看到
<span style="color: red;">对话内容的便于人类观察</span>
Not only inside the empty and dialogue preview you can see on the slide

182
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,705
但也在最后的游戏层面
But also on the final game level

183
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:15,000
所以多亏了这个
So thanks to this

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,430
他们为粒子位置制作了泰勒省略内容
They crafted taylor omit content for a particle location

185
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,220
现在当然让我们看看它是如何工作的
Now of course let's see how it works

186
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,190
我们在时间轴上也有同样的例子
we have the same example on from the timeline

187
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,250
只需通过一个按钮
And just passing one button

188
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,060
您可以在最终游戏关卡中进入相同的对话
You can enter the same dialogue on the final game level

189
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,920
所以现在你可以看到最终的照明阴影
So now you can see the final lighting shadows

190
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,990
呃，角色周围的所有道具
uh , all the props around the characters

191
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,360
这是非常有用的功能
That's very useful feature

192
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,300
因此，时间线是我们的游乐场，您可以快速有效地放置活动和创建内容
So timeline was our playground that you can put events and create content in fast and efficient way

193
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,470
甚至基于方法易于使用且易于扩展
And even based approach is easy to use and easy to extent

194
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,077
所以我认为新功能对程序员来说不是问题
So i think new feature wasn't an issue for programmers

195
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,930
正如您将看到的演示文稿的下一部分
And as you will see the next part of the presentation

196
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,110
几乎每一个视觉的基本对话都由 tn 控制
Almost every visual elementary dialogue was controlled by tn

197
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,540
好
Okay

198
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
所以现在你知道时间轴是什么了
So now you know what the timing is

199
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,320
那么让我们谈谈我们如何感知内容
So let's talk about how we can fd with content

200
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,590
那么我们来谈谈 对话 设计师的工作流程
So let's talk about dao designers workflow

201
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,470
首先是对话集
The first thing is the dialog set

202
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:24,340
对话框集是一个模板，其中包含字符列表以及有关它们的一些基本信息
Dialog set is a template that contains the list of the characters with some basic information about them

203
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,630
例如位置
Like position

204
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,512
情绪状态、帖子等
Emotional state , posts and so on

205
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:32,050
所以对话集就像对话状态的快照
so dialogue set is like a snapshot of a dialogue state that

206
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,210
如有必要，我们可以横向使用或倾向于
We can laterally use or tend to if necessary

207
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,280
下一步是生成器
The next step is the generator

208
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,450
这听起来很疯狂，尤其是对于艺术家来说
It sounds crazy , especially for the artist

209
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,920
他们可生成我们的代码
<span style="color: red;">脚本语言？Ink？</span>
But we do generate dios by code

210
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,040
一般用途是使时间线与基本事件相匹配
General purpose is to fit timeline with basic events

211
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,400
所以它创造了对话的第一遍
So it creates the first pass of the dialogue

212
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,225
看
Look

213
00:13:53,225 --> 00:14:00,160
设计师发现，对每一个角色的每一个事件进行简化修复修正要快的多
<span style="color: red;">对于这样一套系统可以实现快速让设计师针对每一个角色每一个事件进行修复和修改，快速迭代</span>
Designers found out that it's much faster to fix or modify existing events than to insect every event

214
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,590
每次或每个角色
Every time or every character

215
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,860
对于一些不太重要的对话，生产器运转的很好
generator workeds so well that some of the less important dialogues

216
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,900
可以被人手轻轻触摸
Could be bly touched by the human hand

217
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,720
那么它是如何工作的
So how it works

218
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,360
Tentle 需要三种不同类型的输入
Tentle requires three different types of inputs

219
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,410
演员信息
The information about the actors

220
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,730
所以或多或少的对话设置
so more or less dialogue set

221
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,300
像电影一样的规则
The set of rules like cinema

222
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,660
电影摄影，就像一百八十个 rul 是什么
Cinematography like what is the one hundred eighty rul

223
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,340
或者说建制派有什么 sht
Or what does the establishment sht

224
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,760
最后是从画外音中提取的数据
And finally the extracted data from voiceovers

225
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,870
所以我不想用细节咬你
So i don't want to bite you with details

226
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,950
但重要的是我们使用 MFCC
but what's important is that we use mfcc

227
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,590
我习惯于从 vers 的声音中产生市场或口音
I oridden to generate markets or accents from the voice of vers

228
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,940
因此，稍后您可以将事件和动画与声音相匹配
So later you can match the the events and animation with the sound

229
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,470
所以我们把一整天的时间都放在发电机上
So we put to put all the day time to the generator

230
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,410
它会像摄像机一样生成事件
And it generates events like cameras

231
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,920
U 嗯，面部动画板排放
U um , facial animation board emissions

232
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,110
他们看起来
And they look a

233
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,100
所以当然让我们看看它是如何工作的
So of course let's see how it works

234
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,160
玛丽娜女士，我们可以谈谈利维亚的加勒特吗
Madam marina , can we talk garrett of rivia

235
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,550
蒲公英告诉我们很多关于你的事
Dandelions told us so much about you

236
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,620
他和你在一起吗
Is he with you

237
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,210
不
No

238
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,070
但我希望尽快把他带回来
But i hope to bring him back soon

239
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,805
这里来聊聊doodoo
Here to talk about doodoo

240
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:27,730
让我们在剧院后面的宿舍里说话吧
let's speak in my quarters at the back of the theatre

241
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,007
在那里会不受干扰
Will be undisturbed there

242
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:30,620
好
Okay

243
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,420
并且可以连续生成一次吗
And can you can generate generated one more time in row

244
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,460
那两颗种子和喜欢特别准备的
those two seeds and like special prepared

245
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,490
玛丽娜女士，我们可以谈谈利维亚的花园吗
Madam marina , can we talk garret of rivia

246
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,020
蒲公英告诉我们很多关于你的事
Dandelions told us so much about you

247
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,235
他和你在一起吗
Is he with you

248
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:49,680
没有，但我希望尽快把他带回来
No , but i hope to bring him back soon

249
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,425
这里来聊聊dudm
Here to talk about dudm

250
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:54,100
让我们在我的宿舍里说话吧
Let's speak in my quarters

251
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,340
在剧院的后面
At the back of the theatre

252
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,980
在那里会不受干扰
Will be undisturbed there

253
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,020
好的，现在我又多了一个设置的例子
Okay , and now i have one more example of a little bit different settings

254
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,300
这个视频真的很长
This video is really long

255
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,860
所以我只展示了第一个例子
so i would like to show you on the the first interation

256
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,080
稍后您可以在奖励幻灯片部分观看
And later you can watch it in the bonus slide section

257
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,840
我一个人进去
I'll go in alone

258
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,680
你知道你会呆在外面
You know you'll stay outside

259
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,970
我不能让你一个人走
I can't let you go alone

260
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,960
歌词大意： 你发生任何事，达雷尔不要扯掉我的头
Anything happens to you , darrell don't rip my head off

261
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,085
必须有人确保我们的撤退
Someone must secure our retreat

262
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,900
必然会有一场斗争
There's bound to be a struggle

263
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,770
事情可能会变得激烈
Things could get intense

264
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,470
我们需要快速逃离
We'll need to flee fast

265
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,140
消失在人群中
Disappear in the crowd

266
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,380
好
Okay

267
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,900
所以同上，拯救了很多设计师
So ditto saved a lot of designers st

268
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,820
当然，遗传场景的质量没有cu
Of course the quality of genetic scene is not as high as a cu

269
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,060
定制卡斯汀
Custom made custine ine

270
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,942
但这不是遗传的 g
But it wasn't genetal g

271
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:56,025
使用此工具，您可以生成非常快速的不同对话变化
Using this tool , you can generate very fast different dialogue variations

272
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:59,630
因此，如果您不喜欢当前的、呃、对话实例，则没有问题
So if you don't like current , uh , dialogue instance , there's no problem

273
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,750
只需按一个按钮
Just press one butto

274
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,260
你有新的，呃，迭代
<span style="color: red;">按下按钮产生随机迭代，微调设计师不喜欢的剧情</span>
And you have new , uh , iteration

275
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,998
所以以后你可以修复你不喜欢的东西
So later you can fix things you don't lik

276
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:07,950
只要你有时间，呃
As long as you have time for , uh

277
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,710
或者只要有必要
Or as long as it's necessary

278
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,070
下一个对话是手动处理的
Next dialogue is processed by hand

279
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,296
第一对话设计师改进指挥官工作
First dialogue designers improve the commander work

280
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:21,338
因此，存储有关摄像机的一些基本信息的对话
So the dialogues that stores some basic information about the cameras

281
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:23,450
因此，相同的镜头可以重复使用
So the same shots can be reused

282
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,170
确保凝聚力
Which ensures cohesion

283
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,050
还可以为特殊情况创建自定义镜头
It's also possible to create custom shots for special cases

284
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,310
所以即使是呃，插值方法也是如此
So with even uh , interpolation metho

285
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:41,310
设计师可以创建有趣的镜头，以平衡常见的肩膀对话摄像机
designers can create interesting shots that balanced common over the shoulder dialog cameras

286
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,035
接下来是um角色项目的时间了
Next is time it's time for um character item

287
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:50,260
我认为对我们来说尤为重要
i think are especially important for us

288
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,700
因为有类似未来角色表现的基础
because there are like foundation for future character performance

289
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,460
因此，我们每种角色类型有将近 35 种不同的理想动画
So we had almost thirty five different ideal animations per character type

290
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,670
所以这意味着每个女人三十五岁
So it means thirty five per woman

291
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,412
每人三十五，侏儒等等
Thirty five per man , dwarf and so on

292
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:14,900
此外，我们有不同的姿势或不同的姿势，如坐着、站着、kne
Additionally , we have different iters or different poses like sitting , standing , kne

293
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,930
所以每个偶像都是从自由的社会地位类别中选择的
So each idol is chosen from free categories of social status

294
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,850
情绪化状态和帖子
Emotionalized state and posts

295
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,620
所以它很好地映射到重组中
<span style="color: red;">树形结构的角色数据库，目标是实现设计师的快速适配</span>
<span style="color: red;">2077角色动画数据库：
Generic_Famale_Work_Stand_2h_On_sides_ ： Stand_2h_On_Side_01_Cheer</span>
So it maps nicely into a restructure

296
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,990
例如，高攻击性站立
for example , high aggressive standing

297
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,010
或高强度座椅
Or high gressive seating

298
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,245
好的，下一步我们的外观
Okay next step our look a

299
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:41,980
看看是我们为delo设计师提供的最强大的动画工具之一
Look at are one of our most powerful animation tool for delo designers

300
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,800
因此，解释我们的解决方案很重要，其中有两个
So it's important to explain our solution in which are two

301
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,760
我们使用程序观察它通过旋转躯干头部来工作
We use procedual look at it worked by rotating the head of torso

302
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,890
通过在代码中设置愤怒
By setting anger in code

303
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,040
所以这是常见的解决方案
So it's common solution

304
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,872
但它不适合更复杂的 iter，比如坐着躺着
But it doesn't go well with more complicated iters like sitting on laying

305
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,830
那么在哪些地方是免费的 i
So in which are free i

306
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,462
Immeters 希望完全控制姿势
Immeters wanted to have full control over poses

307
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,740
所以我们决定实现动画基础
So we decided to implement animation base

308
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,020
看看人少极解决方案
look at the less people polar solution

309
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,870
对于 algorit 的输入来说非常有趣，这是一个动画
As is quite interesting for the input for the algorit is an animation

310
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,317
我们看姿势
We look at pose

311
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:19,040
例如，我们有一个姿势
and for instance we have one pose

312
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,375
但每两个动画师都可以根据需要创建任意数量的姿势
But every second animator can create as many poses as needed

313
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,870
所以帖子是否像替身一样简单并不重要
So it doesn't matter if the post is simple like standin

314
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,670
或者像坐着一样复杂
Or it's more complicated like sitting

315
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,670
所以在这种情况下，Cracter 接触地面
So in this case cracter touches the ground

316
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,240
这不是问题，因为每个姿势都是由动画师创建的
It's not an issue because every single pose is created by animator

317
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,500
因此，我们修改整个姿势的关键事实
so the keys fact that we modify the whole pose

318
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,580
不仅是头部或头部等少数骨头
Not only the the few bones like head or also

319
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,650
所以多亏了这个
so thanks to this

320
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,270
我们不需要像那样写 Uber
we don't need to write like that uber

321
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,890
查看支持每种特殊情况（如常设引用）的国王代码
Look at king code that supports every special case like standing cit

322
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,580
倪英
Neeing

323
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,330
但是你可以写一个非常简单的代码
But you can write a very simple code

324
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,790
对于每一个特殊情况
And for every special case

325
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,570
我们可以特别看看动画
We can have a special look at animation

326
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,730
所以这个解决方案是全的，全数据数据驱动
So this solution is full , full data data drive

327
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,450
而且很有艺术家的风格
And is very artist strandy

328
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,857
那么它是如何工作的
So how it works

329
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:14,577
正如我所提到的，注视姿势的算法和动画的输入
As i mentioned , the input for algorithms and animation of look at poses

330
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:16,170
所以对于每个姿势
So for every pose

331
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,750
我们计算其中
We calculate where the

332
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,922
呃，看看目标是
Uh , look at target is

333
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:23,720
所以稍后再说，记住所有这些要点并创建一个
So here with this later , recollect all these points and create one

334
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,570
角色周围的三个网格
Three mesh around the character

335
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,110
而你有一次，当你从对话中得到目标时
And you one time when you have the target from the dialogue

336
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,107
所以这个黄色的盒子
So this yellow box

337
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:35,060
黄色框位置被投影到这三个网格体上
The yellow box position is projected onto this three mesh

338
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,867
像一个三角形一样给予气体
Giving gas like one triangle

339
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,150
从这个三角形开始
From this one triangle

340
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,930
我们有 ， 呃 ， 三个顶点
We have , uh , three vertices

341
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,370
这意味着自由看姿势
It means free look at pose

342
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,430
就像将这三个姿势与适当的 ， 呃 混合在一起
Like blending these three poses with proper , uh

343
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,990
使用 proo sc 坐标的比例为我们提供了适当的变形
Proportion using proo sc coordinates gives us proper deformation

344
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,100
我们有两个级别，呃，用于查看角色
And we have two levels , uh , for the look at for character

345
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,200
像全身或正面一样
Like full body or head on

346
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,960
所以这意味着你必须创造，嗯
So it means that you had to create , um

347
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,230
献给那些看动画的每一个
To the dedicate that look at an animation by every single either

348
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,250
其中一些非常简单
Some of them are very simple

349
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,265
他们中的一些人几乎是自由的。六十
Some of them were almost free . sixty

350
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:13,930
也可以创建外观 ， 嗯 ， 冰
It's also possible to create a look at for , um , ice

351
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,030
但它已经完成了面部动画
But it's done for the facial animmation

352
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,050
瑞克
Rick

353
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,270
那么现在让我们看看决赛是
so now let's see the final is that

354
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
所以总结动画底座
So summarize the animation base

355
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,180
从代码的角度来看，它非常简单
Look at it's very simple from code point of view

356
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,427
充满数据驱动的解决方案
Full of data driven solution

357
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:36,570
像动画师一样，呃，可以完全控制姿势
Like animators , uh , have full control over poses

358
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,750
在实践中，这并不耗时
And in practice it's not time consumin

359
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,890
因为他们只需要创造姿势
Because they have to create only poses

360
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,290
不像完整的动画
Not like the full animation

361
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:48,010
因此，使用像我的情感这样的软件非常简单快捷
So using software like my emotion via it's quite easy and fast to do

362
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,270
因为它是基于动画，呃，资源
And because it's based on the animation , uh , resources

363
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,570
程序员可以离线地对这些资产进行关联
Programmers can allize those assets offline

364
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,670
并在一个时间内
And in one tim

365
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,500
您可以创建许多有趣的变体 ，就像所有扩展一样
You can create many interesting variations , like all extensions

366
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,430
呃，就像程序转换一样
Uh , like procedure transitions

367
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,710
第二种情绪或喊叫
Second emotion or over the shouts

368
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,500
好
Okay

369
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,930
那么让我们从卢卡斯转向动画
So let's move from lucas to animations

370
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,035
我们有超过两千四百个专门的对话动画
We had over twenty four hundred the dedicated dialogue animation

371
00:22:13,035 --> 00:22:15,770
喜欢您加工的许多内容
Like so much content you machine

372
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,410
但我们必须将这个数字除以数字
But we have to divide this number by number

373
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,280
呃，字符类型
Uh , of character types

374
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,550
情绪状态、姿势等
Emotional state , poses , and so on

375
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,460
所以最终只有一堆，嗯，手势
So it's end up that there's only a bunch of , um , gestures

376
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,020
但每一个想法
But every single idea

377
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,810
此外，我们必须计算大多数 stas
Moreover , we have to count most stas

378
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,240
井
Well

379
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,290
其中一些人有复杂的对话，内容很多
Some of them had sophisticated dialogues with a lot of content

380
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,210
所以因为这个限制
So because of this limits

381
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,760
我们必须尽可能依赖重用动画
We have to rely on reusing animations wherever possible

382
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,930
让我们继续练习吧
Let's go on practice

383
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,155
即使是像迪士尼这样最伟大的人也做到了
And even the greatest ones like like disney did it

384
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:51,117
所以在未来的对话系统中
So in future dialogue system

385
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:54,740
其他动画可以作为普通的 aldative 或覆盖来播放
Other animation can be played as a normal aldative or override

386
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,220
我们可以等待或掩盖 ou
We can wait down or mask ou

387
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,265
发送了部分骨架
Sent a part of the skeleton

388
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:03,320
整个动画剪辑可由用户定义的曲线控制
The whole animation clip can be controlled by the user defined curves

389
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,567
因此，所有这些简单的作都给了设计师很大的自由度
So all these simple operations gives a lot of freedom to designers

390
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:10,950
所以我将用一个简单的例子来重新强调这一点
So i'm going to restay this on the soup on a simple example

391
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,470
因此，假设您想使用带有站立姿势的 ugesture 以防万一
so let's assume you'd like to use ugesture with standing pose for sitting in case

392
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,320
所以在时间线的第一部分
So on the first part of the timeline

393
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,630
你可以看到站着，或者我们站着的手势
You can see the standing either we're standing gesture

394
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,000
在时间线的第二部分使用 ， uh ， ida
On the second part of the timeline is useating , uh , ida

395
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,930
所以你只需复制支付 ， 嗯 ， 手势
So you just copy pays the , um , the gesture

396
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,180
当然不行。是的
Of course it doesn't work . yeah

397
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,460
但是我们可以在很长一段时间内将这个动画转换为加法
but we can convert this animation into the additive in long time

398
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,180
所以现在好多了
So now it's much better

399
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,250
但你仍然可以在草地上看到一些文物 ex
But still you can see some artifacts on the grass ex

400
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,080
所以使用掩蔽鹅砝码
So using the masking goose weights

401
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,765
我们可以选择骨架的设置部分
We can select the setting part of the skeleton

402
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,560
那么让我们来调整一下这个部分
So let's adapted about the part

403
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,170
好吧，现在好多了
Okay , and now it's much better

404
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:07,680
史蒂夫
Steve

405
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,520
质量不如专用的解读动画高
The quality is not as high as a dedicated deleanimation

406
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,940
但正如你所看到的，我们做到了
But as you saw , we did it

407
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,460
我们以第二名的成绩做到了
We did it in second

408
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,200
我们以这种方式重用了大量的动画
And we reuse a lot of animmation this way

409
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,890
对话动画系统中的下一个测试是控制 rc
The next testing featured in dialog animation system is control rc

410
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,890
我们在 sulting maker 中发现并获得了此功能的灵感
We found and inspiration for this feature in sulting maker

411
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,970
这对我来说就像很棒的软件
Which is like amazing software for me

412
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,980
能够在编辑器中创建特殊情况的姿势
Being able to create poses within the editor for special case

413
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,080
赋予设计师很大的权力
Gives a lot of power to designers

414
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,620
我的意思是，两个设计师不是动画
I mean that two designers not animatoe

415
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,320
因为多亏了控制装置
Because thanks to the control rig

416
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,880
每个人都可以在 dialoe deitto 中创建自定义内容
Everyone can create custom content within in the dialoe deitto

417
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,910
因此，我们主要将它们用于免费案例来创建自定义帖子
So we use them mostly for free cases to create a custom post

418
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,660
在实践中，我们不会使用那么多，因为它很耗时
In practice we don't use that much because it's time consuming

419
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,880
所以它主要用于最终细节
So mostly it was used for final details

420
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,680
像在头部调整时手指放在手上
Like during the head adjust in the fingers on hands

421
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,680
这个程序已经出来了。所以我不这么多看
This program is out . so i don't don't look at this much

422
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,770
好的，接下来是手势的修正
Okay , next is correction for gestures

423
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,180
这是相当有趣的灵魂
It's quite interesting soul

424
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,140
我们来分析一下
Let's analyse it

425
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,070
对于这种情况，我们有两个字符
for this case we have two characters

426
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,462
而你还想为警卫添加像我和你一样的手势
And you would like to add gesture like me and you for the guard

427
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:28,500
所以在这种情况下，一切都很完美
So in this scenario like everything works perfectly

428
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,040
但让我们稍微移动一下下界
but let's move the nether like a little bit

429
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,750
所以现在这个手势就像没有壮举情绪化一样
So now this gesture like doesn't feat emo

430
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,960
所以我们有两个选择
So we have two options

431
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,200
我们可以旋转瓜特
We can rotate the guart

432
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,555
但让我们假设在这种情况下您无法做到这一点
But let's assume you cannot do this in this case

433
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:49,280
或者我们可以应用集合
Or we can apply the collection

434
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,700
所以我们在时间轴上插入 post 键
so we insert the post key on the timeline

435
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,720
并使用控件
And use the control

436
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,080
你可以，呃
You can the , uh

437
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,840
旋转手或头部
Rotate the hand or head

438
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,060
因此，当我们将此帖子更正与动画链接时
So when we link this post correction with the animation

439
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,600
应用于校正的适当时间总量
The proper time aggree applied for the correction

440
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,620
是的，所以现在好多了
yeah , so now it's much better that

441
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,060
好的，喜欢单个手势
Okay , and like on single gestures

442
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,500
您也可以对此进行更正
You can apply corrections on this as well

443
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,980
大多数情况下，我们使用它们来修复网格父权问题，如本例所示
And mostly we use them for fixing mesh patregic issue like on this example

444
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,900
所以我们最终为相反的、呃、预设创建一个小型数据库
So it's end up that we create a small database for contrary , uh , presets

445
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,520
因此，我们可以在几秒钟内解决此类问题
So we can fix issues like this in seconds

446
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,520
面部控制的工作原理类似
And facial control work similarly

447
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,300
所以你可以创建自定义的，呃，姿势
So you could create the custom , uh , poses

448
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,785
您可以对手势或其他手势应用更正
You can apply the corrections for gestures or for others

449
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,220
所以重复我自己
So to repeat myself

450
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,350
我想向您展示控制面板
I would like to show you the , the control panel

451
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,380
所以这次不是，呃，骨头
So this time instead of , uh , bones

452
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,900
我们有很多纵杆，用于不同的、呃、面部变形
We have , uh , plenty of joysticks for different , uh , facial deformations

453
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,740
好
Okay

454
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,480
因此，使用流水线的带有动画的控制绑定
So control rigs with animation that are using pipelin

455
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,330
给设计师很大的自由度
Gives a lot of freedom to designers

456
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,360
他们可以在对话框中创建自定义内容
They can create custom content within the dialog

457
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,310
它就像按需一样，呃
Itor like on demand it's uh

458
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,690
这非常重要，因为时间紧迫
This is very important because with tight schedules

459
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,250
你要么可以创造一些东西，要么可以混合一些东西
You either be able to create something or mix something seconds

460
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,010
或者你必须离开并润色对话并进入下一个对话
Or you have to leave and polish dialogue and move to the next one

461
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,040
好
Okay

462
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,280
放置所有物品，呃
Placing all items , uh

463
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,332
而道具是对话设计师的最后阶段，呃，工作
And props is the last stage of dialogue designers , uh , work

464
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,770
所以正如我向你展示的那样
So as i showed you

465
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,870
每个 stin 元件都可以一次移动
Every stin element can be moved at a time

466
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,030
我们可以使用 ， 呃
We can use , uh

467
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,722
即使是 ulation 方法或更忙碌的小牛来应用简单的动画
Even the ulation methods or busier calves to apply simple animations

468
00:27:55,722 --> 00:27:57,420
当我们有很多道具时
When we have a lot of prop

469
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,300
我们可以将 ， 呃 ， 每个附加到每个 其他
And we can attach , uh , each to each othe

470
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,550
或者除了对每个其他
Or other than to each othe

471
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,310
或者当你有动画时
Or when you have the animations

472
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,830
这些可以同步
Those can be synchronized

473
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,740
所以所有这些小事都帮助我们创造，嗯
So all these little things help us to create , um

474
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,380
在游戏世界中扎根的细节
Details that rooted steam within the game world

475
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,560
这就是对话设计师的工作流程
And that was the dialogue designers workflow

476
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,060
所以现在你知道对话的视觉方面是如何完成的了
So now you know how the visual side side of the dialogue is done

477
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,960
所以我要总结一下这个标准
So i'm going to summarize this par

478
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,072
并向您展示进度镜头
And show you the progress shots

479
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,850
呃，其中一个，呃，游戏中的对话
Uh , of the one of this , uh , dialogue from the game

480
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,230
因此，我们可以看到它在示例上的工作原理
So we can see how it works on the examples

481
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,490
所以首先我们有空的时间线
So first we have the empty timeline

482
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,455
我们录制了画外音
We've recorded voiceovers

483
00:28:36,455 --> 00:28:39,550
我们使用生成器来创建对话的第一遍
We use generator to create the first pass of dialogue

484
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,110
看
Look

485
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,320
你在那里
You're there

486
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,720
先生
Mr

487
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,700
机器人是一个词。不耐烦的巴斯特
Robot was a word . impatient baster

488
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,200
哦，没什么
Oh , nothing

489
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,660
快到那里
Be there soon

490
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,140
好的，接下来我们从第一阶段进入下一阶段
Okay , next we move from the first stage to the next one

491
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,020
因此，设计师改进了相机、IDER 和动画
so designers improve the cameras , iders and animations

492
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,460
你在那里，先生
You there , mr

493
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,530
知更鸟。什么词
Robin . what's the word

494
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,540
不耐烦的老既得
Impatient old vested

495
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,610
哇
Wow

496
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,020
什么都不会很快出现
Nothing be there soon

497
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,240
好
Okay

498
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,000
然后是最后阶段
And then final stage

499
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,320
所以最后的润色
So the final polish

500
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,010
呃
Uh

501
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,460
面部动画校正和所有细节
Facial animation corrections and all the details

502
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,680
你在那里，罗宾先生，这是什么
You there mr robin what's the wor

503
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,220
不耐烦的老混蛋，但很快就会到那里
impatient old bastard but nothing be there soon

504
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,320
好的，像这样简单的事情花了几分钟才完成
Okay , simple thing like this took a few minutes to be done

505
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,640
即使对于像我这样的人
Even for guys like me

506
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,520
好
Okay

507
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,290
所以一开始我说我们必须创建一千四百个对话
So at the beginning i said that we had to create fourteen hundred dialogues

508
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,447
所以我们有了构建块
So we've got the building blocks

509
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:04,940
我们可以生成对话，也可以混合现有的、呃、通用的片段
We can generate the dialogue or we can mix existing , uh , generic pieces

510
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,055
但是有哪些特殊情况
But what are the special cases

511
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:11,010
特殊外壳制作，像独一无二、手工制作和类似custin
Special case made that like unique , handmade and similar to custin

512
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,310
我们的第二个目标是什么
What was our second goal

513
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,737
这种对话应该有与保姆相同的感觉
That dialogue should have the same feeling the custin has

514
00:30:15,737 --> 00:30:20,200
现在让我们看看如何在 aluate deor 中创建自定义案例
So now let's see how we can create custom cases within the aluate deor

515
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,300
对于 vi
For the vi

516
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,217
这次我想安
This time i would like to ann

517
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:26,090
呃，游戏一开始就蒸气腾腾
Uh , the steam from the beginning of the game

518
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,090
从序幕传近球
From the prologue passing the closeball

519
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,620
那么首先让我们看看对话
So first let's see the dialogue

520
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,510
我们去热烈欢迎它吧
Let's go give it a warm welcome

521
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,420
等
Wait

522
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,420
制作这个
Make this

523
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:49,780
在汽车游戏中跑来跑去时通缉的弓可能会派上用场
across bow wanted in a car game while you run around might come in handy

524
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,320
好吧，所以我们没有特殊的动画来传递交叉 ble
Okay , so we don't have special animmersion for passing cross ble

525
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,280
但是我们有一个接收密钥
But we have one with receiving a key

526
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,980
所以这将是我们的基地
So this will be our base

527
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,307
接下来，我们敲击交叉探头并将其连接到手上
Next we pound the crossover probe and attach it to the hand

528
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:08,870
比如确保弩适合手
like making sure that the crossbow fits to the hand

529
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,010
而摄像机拍摄的。它小心翼翼地说，不要露出他们错过的太多部分
And the camera shot . it said carefully not to show their miss much parts

530
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,490
稍后，您可以使用控制绑定来添加最终细节
And later you can use a control rig for adding final details

531
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,290
就像调整手指和头部一样
Like adjusting the fingers and head

532
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,880
它是 。大功告成
and it's . it's done

533
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,440
那么让我们看看它在最终游戏中的样子
So let's see how it looks in the final game

534
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,010
我们去热烈欢迎你吧
Let's go give you a warm welcome

535
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,140
等等等等，这是
wait wait this is

536
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,480
我 弩 在纸牌游戏中通缉
I cross bow wanted in a card gam

537
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,120
当你跑来跑去时可能会派上用场
While you ran around might come in handy

538
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,080
好
Okay

539
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,120
因此能够创造独特的对话
So being able to create unique dialogue

540
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,122
在巨大的天空中制作它们同样重要
Is equally important to make them on a massive sky

541
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,970
我们不把数量置于质量之上
And we do not put quantity over quality

542
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,110
所以每段对话都应该有一些特殊的东西
So every dialogue should have something specia

543
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:13,357
这让 splay 感觉在情感上依恋了 stor
That makes splay feel emotionally attached to the stor

544
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:17,520
现在让我们看一个更复杂的自定义案例示例
So now let's see a little bit more complicated example of the custom cases

545
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,820
哦不，你听不到我的声音，你不敢吗
oh no you don't hear me don't you dare

546
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,180
请不要这样对我
please don't do this to me

547
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,630
约翰尼·杰洛特
Johnny geralt

548
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,602
你在她做什么
What are you doing her

549
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:47,470
试图挽救他的生命
Trying to save his life

550
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,447
帮帮我，香尼冷静下来
Help me , shanny calm down

551
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:54,820
他死了。我确信可以做点什么
He's dead . i'm sure something can be done

552
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,540
呃，好吧
Uh , okay

553
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,000
如果你认为这是一个 custine
And if you think it's a custine

554
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,600
歌词大意： 它仍然有我们的对话
It's not still have our dialogue

555
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,052
施尼·加勒特修女
Sister shnny garrett

556
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:05,000
你在她做什么
What are you doing her

557
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,920
试图挽救他的生命
Trying to save his life

558
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,840
帮帮我，香尼冷静下来
Help me , shanny calm down

559
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,320
他死了。我确信可以做点什么
He's dead . i'm sure something can be done

560
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,610
呃，呃
Uh , uh

561
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,820
放手吧
let it go

562
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,580
该死
damn it

563
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,100
白白关闭
off for nothing

564
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,700
你尽你所能
you did all you could

565
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,280
谢谢杰洛特
thanks geralt

566
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:35,960
好
Okay

567
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,540
因此，让我们离开 dio 设计器，进入下一个
So let's leave dio designers and move to the next

568
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,880
呃，管道步骤后期制作
Uh , pipeline step post production

569
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,690
所以当你谈论主题时，呃，内容
So when you talk about thematic , uh , content

570
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,787
我认为是考虑的关键因素
I think is crucial element to taking into account

571
00:33:47,787 --> 00:33:50,240
但有时在游戏中我们必须添加光线
but sometimes in games we have to add light

572
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,380
因为如果没有额外的，很难看到发生了什么，我认为
Because it's hard to see what's going on without extra , i think

573
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,630
但对于那些是当故事亲戚的时候
But for the which are when stories a kin

574
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,085
让copus营造一种适当的情绪，比如支持讲故事
Letting copus to create a proper mood like support storytelling

575
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:08,870
因此，从这个阶段可以看到自定义灯的影响有多大
So can see how large impact custom lights have that from this stage on this one

576
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,221
所以，但在开放世界游戏中与日和九周期进行alidialogues并不容易
so , but it's not easy to alidialogues in open world game with day and nine cycle

577
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,469
因为我觉得总是需要好看
Because i think always needs to look good

578
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,449
这不重要
It doesn't matter

579
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,530
就像临近时下雨一样
It's like raining during the nigh

580
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,320
或者说是你星期天下午
Or it's u sunday afternoon

581
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,370
那么让我们看看我们是如何做到的，我们是如何在无印良品中做到的
So let's see how we , how we do it in muji

582
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,921
首先，让它百分百清晰
First , to make it like one hundred percent clear

583
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:33,630
我想分析一下这个超级简单的例子
I would like to analyze the super simple example

584
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,370
所以假设我们想添加，呃
So let's say would we would like to add , uh

585
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,258
黄灯是这个，呃，棒
The yellow light for this , uh , stick

586
00:34:39,258 --> 00:34:43,069
因此，当您将 ，零灯放在水平仪上时
So when you just put the , the zero light on the level

587
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:44,250
看起来还可以
It seems okay

588
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,570
但是当你改变一天的一部分时
But when you change part of the day

589
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,409
这盏灯已经不合适了
This light doesn't fit anymore

590
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:50,829
就像两个黄色的，太亮了
It's like two yellow and too bright

591
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:52,929
所以想要这样的东西
So would like to have something like this

592
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,697
那盏灯有不同的颜色和，嗯
That light has different color and , um

593
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,990
不同时间段的价值
Value during the different part of the days

594
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,670
但我有同样的感觉，同样的影响
But i have the same feeling , the same impact

595
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,960
好的，那么它是如何完成的
Okay , so how it's done

596
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,960
决赛
Final game

597
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,480
最终游戏，呃，光值取决于球光值
Final game , uh , light value depends on globlight value

598
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,872
由闪电艺术家在天气编辑器中设置
Which is set by lightning artists in the weather editor

599
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:30,210
乘以对话光
Multiplied by the dialogue ligh

600
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:35,880
对话设计师在时间轴上设置了事件
Which set in the event in on the timeline by the dialogue designers

601
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,720
而每一个灯光值
And every light value

602
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,880
每个光源属性都不是单个值，而是一条曲线
Every light property is not a single value but a curve

603
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,797
因此，我们可以在一天中的不同时间拥有不同的价值观
So we can have different values of different part of the day

604
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:49,610
当然，让我们再次看看它在决赛中是如何运作的
And of course let's see how it works on the final again

605
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,700
好
Okay

606
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,640
所以让我们认为这是电影内容中超级重要的一部分，呃，内容
So let's think is super important part of the cinematic content , uh , content

607
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,710
即使您必须使用entine循环创建像开放的文字游戏一样
And even when you have to create like open word game with the entine cycle

608
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,487
这个功能不能错过
This feature cannot be missed

609
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,060
我们的解决方案非常适合我们
Our solution works great for us

610
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,420
灯光艺术家创造全局化价值
Lighting artist creates the global alized value

611
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,480
稍后，每个人都可以为对话创建自定义灯光，而不会破坏最终的游戏外观
And later everyone can create custom lights for dialogue without breaking the final game look

612
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,315
后期制作的第二部分是视觉特效和音效
Second part of the post production are vfx and sound effects

613
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,720
它的工作流程与我之前向您展示的相同
It workflow with the same as i showed you before

614
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,310
因此，我们使用时间线来设置特定事件
So we use timeline to set up specific events

615
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,972
您可以及时移动到不同的事物上以获得触摸效果
You can move for touch effects to different things in time

616
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:08,870
不幸的是，我们没有足够的时间来描述所有内容
Unfortunately we don't have enough time to describe everything

617
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,630
但我相信你明白了
But i'm sure you get the idea

618
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,820
好
Okay

619
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,560
这就是，嗯
And that was the , um

620
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,700
Pum 的单个对话，这应该是免费的
Pum of a single dialogue , which should free

621
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,430
所以我们让作家用他们的作品探索对话设计师
so we have the writers quest dialogue designers with their work

622
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,692
喜欢将对话设置发电机相机作为偶像
Tho like dialogue set generator cameras as idols

623
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:28,420
看动画
Look at animations

624
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,540
特殊情况和地理以及最终的后期制作与灯光和效果
Special cases and geography and final post production with lighting and the fects

625
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,010
所以我向您展示了所有这些视频和功能
So i showed you all these videos and features

626
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,612
但正如你可以想象的那样，并非一切都那么容易做到
But as you can imagine , not everything was so easy to do

627
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:42,240
你可以遇到很少的问题
You can have few problems

628
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,930
其中一些值得分享
And some of them are worth to share

629
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,640
所以 which 被本地化为 15 种语言
So the which is localized into fifteen languages

630
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,200
其中八个有不同的 voicover。公平语言版本
And eight of them had different voicovers . fair language version

631
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,597
所以我向你表明，时间线的长度与我们不同的人息息相关
So i show you that the length of the timeline is tied to diverse of us

632
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:57,960
我们没有使用那个存在
We didn't use that being

633
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,062
所以每一节都有不同的持续时间泛语言版本
So every verse over have different duration pan language version

634
00:38:03,062 --> 00:38:07,955
因此，这意味着整个对话的持续时间可能因语言版本而异
So it means that the whole dialogue can have different duration by language version

635
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:11,110
所以你可以想象电影类型的内容
So you can imagine that with cinematic type of content

636
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,510
当一切都小心翼翼地放在时间表上时
When everything is placed carefully on the timelin

637
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,510
并且所有的手势和同步
And all the gestures and synchronized

638
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,985
这是一个真正的问题
This is a real issue

639
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:19,310
因此，您不能只更改时间线的持续时间
So you cannot just change the duration of the timeline

640
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,925
因为一切都会不同步
Because everything will be out of sync

641
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:26,030
因此，对我们有效的解决方案是我们称之为时间线调用
So the solution working for us was something we called timeline scalling

642
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,370
因此，这意味着每个事件都是相对于画外音放置的
So it means that every event is placed relative to voiceover

643
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,760
所以这是关于
So it's about

644
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,520
所以如果配音过它的长
So if voice over its longe

645
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,680
偶数会在不同的绝对时间
Even will be in different absolute time

646
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,590
但与画外音的比例相同
But in the same proportion to voice over

647
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,040
所以有些甚至，呃，有些，呃
So with some even , uh , with some , uh

648
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,090
甚至匹配或加入等功能，效果非常好
Features like even matching or joining , it works really well

649
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,187
所以在这个例子中
So in this example

650
00:38:49,187 --> 00:38:54,337
两者甚至都是画外音的 30% 的开始
And both even starts of the thirty percent of the voiceover

651
00:38:54,337 --> 00:38:56,740
但首先，呃，有不同的日期
But first over , uh , have different dations

652
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,330
所以事件，呃，有不同的，嗯
So the event , uh , have different , um

653
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,300
绝对时间和长度
Absolute time and length

654
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,980
那么当然让我们从
So of course let's analyze it from the

655
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,790
以游戏为例
On the example from the game

656
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,730
所以我们有英文版
So we have the english version

657
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,832
呃
Uh

658
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:12,970
其中需要 ， 呃 ， 十二秒 和法语版本
Which takes , uh , twelve second and french version with

659
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,050
这需要，呃，十四秒
Which takes , uh , fourteen seconds

660
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,320
所以这个，这两秒的空档完全可以做对话
So this , this two second gap can completely doing the dialogue

661
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,420
但由于缩放比例很小，英语应该可以工作
But thanks to the tiny scaling , english should work

662
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,040
好
Okay

663
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,927
所以让我们检查一下它是否触发了英文版
So let's check it fires the english version

664
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:29,250
Uvel，你以为自己是猎魔人吗
Uvel , do you think you are a witcher

665
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,290
猎魔人
A witcher

666
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,717
听说男孩们
Hear that boys

667
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:34,530
任何一种帷幔都获得了丰收的女巫
Either valance got a bumper crop of witches

668
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,160
或者这就是砍掉我们十字路口男孩的混蛋
Or this is the bastard who cut down our boys of the crossroads

669
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,800
现在法语在 fea 中以相同的内容进行相同的对话
And now french the same dialogue with the same content in fea

670
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,940
好的，现在并排查看
Okay , and now side by side view

671
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,590
因此，您可以看到两个实例正在慢慢不同步
So you can see that the both instances are slowly are slowly out of sync

672
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,390
但对于每种情况，一切都完美无缺
but for every instance everything works perfectly

673
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,540
好
Okay

674
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,417
接下来是有趣的挑战是另一个化学反应，我认为
Next is that it interesting challenge was another chemistic which i wor

675
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:27,590
因此，我们付出了很多努力来确保对话
so we put a lot of effort to be sure that dialogue

676
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,570
在播放或编辑过程中，它本身是完全术语的
Itself is completely terministic during playing or editing

677
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:35,150
所以这意味着你可以随时跳过对话的任何部分
So it means that you can skip any part of the dialogue any time

678
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:38,622
在下一帧上，一切都正确更换
And on the next frame everything replaced properly

679
00:40:38,622 --> 00:40:39,930
但同时
But at the same time

680
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,540
我会留下哪个团队放了很多叉子来做
I will leave what team put a lot of fork to make

681
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,180
这些世界充满生机
Which are world full of life vibrant

682
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,300
所以设计
So by by design

683
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,930
哪些不是 ternostic
Which are what is not a ternostic

684
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,200
我们在这方面遇到了一些问题
And we had a few issues with this

685
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,570
例如，来自委员会的 npc 有自己的生活
For instance , npc from committee have their own life

686
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,540
有时这意味着
Sometimes it means that one of the

687
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,015
真的很想成为对话行动的一部分
Really wants to be part of the dialogue action

688
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:05,232
车门前面的车站自动
车门前面的车站自动

689
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:09,010
所以解决方案是在 ， 呃 周围放置和拒绝区域
So the solution was to put and denied area around the , uh

690
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,620
包含所有
Dialogue that contains all the

691
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,170
嗯，演员和摄像机
Um , actors and cameras

692
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,650
但吹了NPI
but blows the npis

693
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,955
再比如可以玩骑马一样的状态
Another example can be played a state like riding a horse

694
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:24,900
所以有时在对话开始时u
So sometimes at the beginning of the dialogu

695
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,840
假设在脚上的球员
Players assumed to be on the foot

696
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,300
因此，我们不能每次在对话开始前都强迫玩家使用该坐骑
so we cannot force to player to this mount every time before dialogue starts

697
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,990
所以我们会播放一个捷径场景
So instead we'll play a shortcut scen

698
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,600
在展示这种坐骑的发挥的对话之前
Before the dialogue that shows the play of this mounting

699
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,630
过场动画融入对话的房子
The house that cut scene blends to the dialogue

700
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,280
从游戏玩法创建平滑过渡
Creating a smooth transition from the game play

701
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,040
好
Okay

702
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,760
现在作为最后一部分
And now as a final part

703
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,850
我将向您展示一些改编的对话
i'm going to show you the dialogue with some adaptations

704
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,900
所以你可以看到所有功能
So you can see all the feature

705
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,000
但它在最后的 中是如何工作的
And but how it works in the , in the final

706
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,540
游戏的最终对话
Final dialogue from the game

707
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,600
我希望这会是一个好地方
I hope this will be a good somewhere

708
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,660
休息一下
Give it a rest

709
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,380
和那批人说话没有意义
No point talking to that lot

710
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,400
所有你都会生气的咯咯声，它们会膨胀起来
All you get angry gurgles and they puff up

711
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,010
你注意到然后钓鱼
You notice while then fish

712
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,020
是那里的寒冷吗
Is it the cold there

713
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,250
这里任何说普通话的人
Anyone here who speaks common

714
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,360
哦，有这个雇佣兵和嗨
Oh there's this mercenary with hi

715
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,800
在我看来好脏
Looks so dirty to me

716
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,972
他是我唯一一个带他穿过下水道的新兵
He's the one recruit of me to show him through the sewers

717
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:35,120
哦
Oh

718
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,850
而法师，是什么导致人们知道它
And the mage , what leads the knows of it

719
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,770
听到他说我的疑惑
Heard him talking my doubt

720
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,510
我他们会和你谈谈
I they will talk to you

721
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,310
呃，我是你经常短的 e
Uh , i was you constant short e

722
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,730
不要继续让我失望，直到我有一段漫长的航程
Not go on flopping me till me got a long voyage ahead

723
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,010
袖子不是我所需要的
Sleeves is not what i nee

724
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,260
一个我真正可以与之交流的人，这就是我想要的
Someone i could actually communicate with that's what i want

725
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,860
问候杰洛特记住我
greetings geralt remember me

726
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,580
我记得我们在白色果园约克冈特路相遇，没有人
I remember we met in white orchard york gaunter road din none

727
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,260
同样作为大师镜子，我帮你找到了一个 miyennifer

也就是说，如果这个 slog 没有先杀死你

与您的情况没有什么不同

我可以试着把你从这里救出来，你知道的
I could try to extract you from here , you know

因为你确实想下船，所以你不这样做吗？

事实上

这是一笔交易

我们将在午夜在十字路口相遇

遇见yantra村附近的柳树

754
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,120
这是什么标志，可以向我们的员工展示
what's that a mark to show we associates

755
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,530
你是不是在和任何人都喋喋不休地喋喋不休
are you gabbing me with no one

756
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,830
哦，在轻微的音符中，一点也不
oh in a light note not one bit

757
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,090
歌词大意： 他们让我的魔鬼让我踩链
They have my devils make me stomp chain

758
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,830
呃，我们一直在努力通过整个薄

759
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,810
在

760
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,930
好
Okay

761
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,247
那么，有什么想法要做
So what's the thought of doing

762
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:32,020
我相信我们的对话系统是成功的
I believe that our dialogue system is a success

763
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:37,817
我们制作了 35 小时的电影内容，没有动画师大军
We made thirty five hours of cinematic content without army of animator

764
00:45:37,817 --> 00:45:40,160
带有定制外壳的会议手套
meeting gloves with custom cases

765
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,760
让我们能够创造令人难忘的高质量对话
allow us to create memorable dialogues with good quality

766
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,665
这帮助我们将 storted 设置为主要游戏功能
That helped us set storted as a main game feature

767
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:50,990
扎实灵活的对话
Solid and flexible dialogue detai

768
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,230
在一个地方提升我们的艺术家
Boost our artist in one place

769
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,410
每个人都可以尝试 从头到尾创建对话
Everyone can try create dialogue from the beginning to the end

770
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,780
不是 teristic，呃，哪个奖项是一个挑战
Not teristic , uh , which award was a challenge

771
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,760
但由于动态等功能
But thanks to the features like dynamic

772
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,680
我觉得每一个，每个玩家都能看到自己的版本
I think every , every player can see his own version of

773
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,120
呃，对话和故事
Uh , dialogue and story

774
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,580
当然，没有时间做所有事情
And of course there's no time to do everything

775
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,670
我们不得不削减很多功能
We had to cut a lot of features

776
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,220
但所有这些我们没有的未完成的想法和知识
But all this unfinished ideas and knowledge that we have no

777
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,880
我们正在用于我们的新游戏
We are using for our new game

778
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,840
Seelefunk 二十七十七
Seelefunk twenty seventy seven

779
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,560
因此，如果您想成为其中的一部分
So if you like to be part of this

780
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,580
我们是高歌猛进
we are high goes

781
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:33,720
奥卡
Oka

782
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,420
所以
so

783
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,230
有幻灯片部分的炸弹
There's a bomb of slides section

784
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:43,055
你知道，它们将在 gdc 螺栓上可用
You know , on the they will be available on gdc bolt

785
00:46:43,055 --> 00:46:47,460
所以我做了一堆带有额外细节的视频和幻灯片
so i did a bunch of videos and slides with extra details

786
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,320
所以我们以后总是可以做
So we can always do it later

787
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,820
如果你喜欢未来的游戏
And if you like the future game

788
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,340
今年我们还有两场关于 gdc 的演讲
We have two more presentations of this year gdc

789
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,580
所以你也可以检查一下
So you can check it out as well

790
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,320
就这样
And that's all

791
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,600
所以如果你有任何问题，比如请拍摄
so if you have any questions like please shoot

792
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,580
和supernovl
And supernovl

793
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,740
所以请只问简单的问题
So please ask only simple questions

794
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,140
您展示的工具中有多少是第三方工具，而不是内部开发的
How many of the tools that you showed were third party versus developed internally

795
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,405
还有多少工程人员在开发内部工具
And how much of your engineering staff was developing the internal tools

796
00:47:29,405 --> 00:47:29,820
好
Okay

797
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,080
所以，嗯，我向你展示的所有工具都是制作出来的，嗯
So , um , all the tools i showed you are made , um

798
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,110
内部在我们的 ， 在我们的 ， 呃 ， 红色引擎
Internally in our , in our , uh , red engine

799
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:39,500
所以我们只使用，呃，外部工具
So we use only , uh , external tools

800
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,260
就像我对动画和其他内容的情感赌注一样
Like my emotion beter for animations and the rest

801
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,000
一切都内置于系统中
Everything is built into the system

802
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,320
即使像剧本一样，嗯
Even if like the screen play like the , um

803
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,300
甚至像四种工具的效果
Even like the four tool for the effects

804
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,327
一切都在我们的细节和工程师身上
And everything is one place in our detail and about the engineers

805
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:55,610
所以我向你展示了我们的团队在一开始就
So i showed you that our team on the , on the beginnin

806
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,230
和
and

807
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,290
我们有，呃，三个程序员
We had , uh , three programmers

808
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,592
比如，呃，一位高级和，呃，两位专家
Like , uh , one senior and , uh , two specialists

809
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:08,010
我们必须创建所有内容，例如功能和动画部分
And we had to create everything like features and animation parts

810
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,610
通过任务的联系
The connection through the quest

811
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:10,950
甚至所有工具
And even all the tool

812
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,430
所以这就像自由的人
So that are like free peopl

813
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,432
其余的都是艺术家
And the rest are artists

814
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:17,760
所以，对话图和时间线
So the , the dialogue graph and the timelines

815
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,580
所有这些都是内部开发的
All of those are internally developed

816
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,040
是的
Yes

817
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,500
是的
Yes

818
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,140
一切都在一个，呃，繁殖者
Everything is on only one , uh , breeditor

819
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:23,560
是的
Yeah

820
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,160
你
you

821
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,620
嗨，好谈
Hi , great talk

822
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,220
在
Um

823
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,280
叙事驱动游戏的很大一部分是，嗯
So big part of the narrative driven games is that , um

824
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,505
有些人想跳过对话
Some people want to skip dialogues

825
00:48:36,505 --> 00:48:38,360
嗯，哈哈
Um , ha ha

826
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,870
你怎么做到的，呃
How did you , uh

827
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:44,580
处理可能像动画没有完成这样的问题，呃，当人们跳过时
Deal with issues of maybe like animations not finishing , uh , when people skip

828
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:44,940
好
Okay

829
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,110
所以，是的
So , yeah

830
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:50,090
它，它开销。当我看到像人们知道跳过对话时
It , it overheads . when i see like the people know skipping the dialogues

831
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,050
我知道其中一些很长
I understand that some of them are long

832
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:54,700
而且，呃，也许太长了
And , uh , maybe to be too long

833
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,757
在
Um

834
00:48:55,757 --> 00:48:56,170
是的
Yeah

835
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,730
所以从技术角度来看
So from the technical point of view

836
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,390
跳过是一个真正的问题
The skipping was a really issue

837
00:48:59,390 --> 00:48:59,950
呃
Uh

838
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,880
因为正如我所说，那个对话必须是完全术语的，呃
Because as i said , that dialog has to be completely terministic , uh

839
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,887
因为当你跳过对话的任何部分时
Because when you skip any part of the dialogue

840
00:49:07,887 --> 00:49:11,690
也许在这部分角色中画一个项目或做某事
Maybe the in this part character and draw a item or do something

841
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,327
以后你需要拥有它
And later you need to have it

842
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:15,420
但我们对编辑也有同样的问题
But the same issue we have for the editor

843
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,460
所以做，甚至做编辑
So doing , even doing the editing

844
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,650
当您按 时，您可以随时按 、 呃 、任何部分
When you press , you can press , uh , any section anytime

845
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,160
和，你应该有合适的框架
And , and you should have the proper frame

846
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:24,820
呃
Uh

847
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,162
所以几乎是一样的问题
So it's almost the same problem

848
00:49:27,162 --> 00:49:28,050
所以，是的
So , yeah

849
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,190
花了很多时间
Took a lot of time to

850
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,010
将所有内容写入
To write everything to

851
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,130
到，拥有它
To , to have it

852
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,370
所以即使从代码的角度来看
So even from the code point of view

853
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:37,300
然后每一步系统
Then every step system

854
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,110
呃，必须由时间线控制
Uh , has to be controled by the timeline

855
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,870
所以在动画中，例如
So in the animations , for example

856
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:45,092
所以你不能像冷却或像 u
So you cannot have like the cool down or like the u

857
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:47,570
呃，在动画系统内部倾倒
Uh , dumping inside the animation system

858
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:53,220
因为当你改变对话的部分时，就像在一帧中一样
Because then when you change the part of the dialogue , like in one frame

859
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,010
你会看到这个垃圾箱正在关闭
You will see this dumpicon going down

860
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:55,730
所以，是的
So , yeah

861
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,170
这是一个丰富的挑战
It was , it was a a rich challenge

862
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,315
我认为这是其中的一个
And i think this is this one of the

863
00:50:00,315 --> 00:50:02,610
让程序员完成此任务
Have this task for programmers to do

864
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:03,510
谢谢
Thank you

865
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,260
嗨，呃，真的很吸引人的谈话
Hi , uh , really fascinating talk

866
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,100
谢谢
Thank you very much

867
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,500
呃，我只是好奇
Uh , i was just curiou

868
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,920
这些工具看起来非常复杂，对你们来说非常有用
How these tools seem insanely complex and extremely useful for you guys

869
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,560
呃，开发多久
Uh , how long into development

870
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,040
你花了时间让一切正常吗
Did it take you to get everything working

871
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,160
或者这只是贯穿整个项目的涓涓细流过程
Or was it just sort of like a trickle process throughout the entire projects

872
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,600
H
H

873
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,190
所以正如我在开头提到的
So as i mentioned at the , at the beginning

874
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,970
我们也为猎魔人准备了对话系统
We had a dialogue system for the witcher too

875
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,250
所以一些工具已经存在
So some of the tools are already there

876
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,030
比如 ， 呃 ， 图表 ，例如
Like , uh , the graph , for example

877
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,220
而剧本
And the screen play

878
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,220
所以这就是我们必须完全写，呃
So that is we have to completely write , uh

879
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,740
因为我们有不同的，你知道的，呃，要求
Because we have the different , you know , uh , requirements

880
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,280
即使那也是术语，什么都想
Even that is the terministic stuff and think anything

881
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,102
所以

00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:40,630
所以，好吧
So , okay

885
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:41,190
所以抨击
So bash

886
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:42,750
正因为如此，呃
Because of this , uh

887
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:47,170
艺术家可以，呃，从一开始就基于 unde 创建一些手指
Artists can could , uh , create some finger from the beginning based on unde

888
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,730
哪个是两个对话者

889
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:50,210
然后我们尝试了解 改进它
And then we try to know improve it

890
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,917
所以，例如，这个，呃，基于动画的外观
So , for example , this , uh , animation based look at

891
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:55,800
我想我认为花了大约一年的时间
I think i think it took like the one year to

892
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,930
要拥有它，就像最后一样，喜欢
To have it like finally , like

893
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,920
因为我们没有不同的任务和一切
Because we had no different tasks and everything

894
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,320
所以，呃
So , uh

895
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,510
但你仍然拥有来自未来的外观
But you still have the the looks from the future too

896
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,150
像这样头对躯干
Like this for head on torso

897
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,030
所以你可以使用它
So you can use it

稍后您甚至可以切换

呃，我有一个关于声音设计的问题

905
00:51:19,487 --> 00:51:21,590
呃，你知道的不多
Uh , you didn't know a lot abou

906
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,750
声音和对话是如何设置的
How the sound and the dialogue was set up

907
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,150
呃
Uh

908
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,610
我的意思是三个 d 参数
I mean the three d parameters

909
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,900
呃，音量等等
Uh , volume and so on

910
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,187
呃，你以前也这样做过
Uh , so did you do it and before

911
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:33,510
之前，呃，在某些特定的第三方环境中
Before , uh , in some specific third party environment

912
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:37,010
或者，您让声音设计师设计声音参数
Or you let your sound designers to design the sound parameters

913
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,370
只是在编辑中
Just in the edit

914
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:40,460
或者当他们设计对话时
Or when they designed the dialog

915
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:40,890
好
Okay

916
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,720
所以老实说，我不确定
So honestly , i'm not sure

917
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,510
因为这部分就像声音设计一样
Because this part is like the the sound design i

918
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,810
歌词大意： 我实际上像个谜一样跳动
I actually beating like a mystery for me

919
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,032
呃
Uh

920
00:51:49,032 --> 00:51:51,720
我认为他们可以创造，呃
I think they can they create , uh

921
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,870
哦，呃
Oh , uh

922
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,200
应该有一些我在这里设计的地方
There should be some where here i was some designing

923
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,560
好
Okay

924
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,060
呃
Uh

925
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,840
但是，嗯，我想，呃
But , um , i think , uh

926
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,560
他们创造了自己的声音，呃，sso
They create a sound of their own , uh , sso

927
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,340
您可以像声音事件一样放置事件
You can put events like sound events

928
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,700
而且，你知道，在声音的时间轴上做一些简单的事情
And , you know , do some , some simple stuff on the timeline of sound

929
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,332
但资产是根据洞察力制作的
But the assets are made like on the insight

930
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:12,990
那么是不是说你不要太执着于这三d五线谱
So does it mean that you don't stick too much to this three d staff

931
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:13,430
等等
And so on

932
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,710
我的意思是，如果你移动相机
I mean that if you move the camera

933
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,370
声音没有变化
The sound is not changing

934
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:16,850
呃
Uh

935
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,070
好
Okay

936
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:20,760
所以你有几个选项来指定这个，呃
So you had a few options to specify this , uh

937
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,760
您可以附加它们
You can attach them

938
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,160
A、声音听众
Um , the sound listener

939
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,330
让我们对着镜头或角色说
Let's say to the camera or to the characters

940
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:28,060
但老实说，我，我，我不确定它是如何完成的
But honestly , i , i , i'm not sure how would how it's done

941
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,260
就像，呃，在引擎盖下
And like , uh , under the hood

942
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,080
所以，好吧

呃，你们真的从 bioware 中得到了启发
Uh , you guys are really inspiring from bioware

948
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,590
所以你们现在正在与我们竞争我们的钱

00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,197
所以，这很棒

在
Um

951
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,300
你对 vo 的依赖程度
How dependent are you on vo

952
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,220
比如你什么时候有 tts 有或有 somethin
Like when do you have tts has or somethin

953
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,580
当你在等待它进来时
While you're waiting for that to come in

954
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,210
或者说是真的，比如投票画外音
Or it's true like vote voiceover

955
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,790
喜欢演技，喜欢
Like the acting , like

956
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,810
在你得到它之前你不努力吗
Do you not work on it until you get it

957
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,110
或者你有 tds 或喜欢文本转语音
Or do you have tds or like text to speech

958
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:56,490
是的
Yeah

959
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:57,207
在
Um

960
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:57,640
好
Okay

961
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,730
所以我希望会有这样的，呃
So i hope that there will be as this , uh

962
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,480
奖励幻灯片部分的简短部分
Short part of about this in bonus slide section

963
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:10,507
但基本上你有两种不同的方法，呃，你可以通过指定保存器
But basically you have two different , uh , ways you can specify the preservers

964
00:53:10,507 --> 00:53:12,880
您可以作为设计师录制零自我的声音
You can record voice over zero self as a designer

965
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,220
所以你可以使用麦克风
So you can using microphone

966
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,850
你有画外音
And you have the voice over

967
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,220
不幸的是，它减少了那么多
And unfortunately reduce it that much

968
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,687
因为没有
Because no

969
00:53:19,687 --> 00:53:21,890
他们，他们想听，你知道，他们的声音
They , they want to hear , you know , their voices

970
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,790
所以第二个选项 ，我们可以使用文本转语音
So a second option , we can use text to speech

971
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,670
所以我们可以根据文本生成
So we can generate the based on the text

972
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,270
我们可以生成声音 fink
We can generate the the sound fink

973
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,270
哪个是基地
Which is a base

974
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,140
它主要用于那个，嗯
It was used mostly that , um

975
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,560
对于你有对话时间的事情
For the thing that you have the timing for the dialogue

976
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,300
稍后，当您从另一边获得最终版本时
And later when you have the final verservers from the across

977
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,620
你可以，呃，你可以把它
You can , uh , you can put it

978
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,160
是的
Yeah

979
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,960
但是，呃，有时这意味着，嗯
But , uh , sometimes it means that , um

980
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,000
你需要多一个步骤来润色对话
You need to have one extra step for polishing a dialogue

981
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,910
当你有最后的 voicovers
When you have the final voicovers

982
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,540
所以有时这是问题所在
So sometimes it was the issue

983
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,740
尤其是对于怪物来说
Especially that for the monster

984
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,380
例如
For example

985
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,900
有很多，呃
There are a lot of , uh

986
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,180
声音上的后期处理
Post processes on the , on the voices

987
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,700
所以有时你可以回声什么的
So sometimes you could the echo or something

988
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,760
所以 ， 嗯 ， 的 ， 持续时间
So , um , the , the duration of the

989
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,240
呃，对话就像，正在增长
Uh , of the dialogue is like , is growing

990
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,527
所以我们需要喜欢
So we need to like

991
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:05,630
我们确保以后也正确地请求所有内容
We make sure that everything is pled properly later also

992
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,337
再次感谢
Thank you again

感谢您的精彩讲座
Thank you for the awesome lecture

994
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,720
呃，我的问题是关于实际的口型同步
Uh , my question is about actually lip sync

995
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,900
而不是在短语长度方面
And not in terms of the phrase length

996
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,540
但就发音而言
But in terms of the articulation

997
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,042
它是如何制作的
How was it made

998
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:17,850
在
Um

999
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:21,510
所以我们用的唇槽不是软的，呃
So we use for the lips sink we used and not soft , uh

1000
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,392
A 选择它后面的标签
A select the tag behind it

1001
00:54:23,392 --> 00:54:27,095
呃，当然我们有不同的椭圆语言版本
Uh , of course we have different ellipinure language version

1002
00:54:27,095 --> 00:54:28,160
然后，呃
And , uh

1003
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,100
你有一个小特征，在嘴唇唱歌开始角色之前
you had a small features that before the lips sing start character

1004
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,940
应该深呼吸或类似小细节的东西
Should take a breath or something like a small detail

1005
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,630
呃
Uh

1006
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,320
有时是可见的，有时不是取决于对话
Sometimes the visible , sometimes it's not depends on the on the dialogue

1007
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,480
在
Um

1008
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,440
但是唇膏，嗯，是面部发射系统的布林斯
But the lipsters , um , is brinto the facial emission system

1009
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,100
所以当你有 ， 呃
So when you have the , uh

1010
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,700
最终动画
Final animation for the

1011
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,920
对于渔夫来说，嘴唇可以像覆盖一些部分一样
For the fisher lips in can like override some of the parts

1012
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,660
而且，你知道的，并很好地融入其中
And , you know , and blend nicely into this

1013
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,470
和，嗯
And , um

1014
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:59,320
所以你仍然可以微笑着说话或类似的事情
So you still can have like a smile and talking or something like this

1015
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:04,170
但是画外音呢，它不是分析声音吗
But what about the voiceover doesn't it analyze the voice

1016
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,130
是的
And yeah

1017
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:05,350
是的
Yeah

1018
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,270
所以我不是，呃
So that i'm not , uh

1019
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,270
我不是这样坦率的
I'm not so forth like this

1020
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,850
您需要将 输入 ， 呃 ， 文本文本
That you need to put the as input , uh , text text

1021
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,830
呃，呃，画外音像波浪一样
Uh , uh , voice over like the wav

1022
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,670
并生成曲线，呃
And generates the curves , uh

1023
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,370
每条曲线都像
And every curve is like the the

1024
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,110
呃，面部帖子
Uh , the facial post

1025
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,840
所以稍后我们将它融入到我们的细节中
So later we blend it into the leglic in our detail

1026
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,520
我们混合它
We blend it

1027
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,960
或者，你知道，我们得到混合它
Or , you know , we gain blend it

1028
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,500
呃，动态地带有一些额外的功能
Uh , dynamically with some extra features

1029
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,610
因为您还可以对面部动画进行校正 
Because you can have also the corrections for the , for the facial animation

1030
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,270
所以我们有很多没有输入
So we have a lot of no input

1031
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,010
然后我们喜欢把它混合在一个地方
Then we like mix it in one place

1032
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:39,940
和、和、呃，一般是最终的队形基于骨骼进行面部动画
And , and , uh , generally the final the formation based on the bones for the facial animation

1033
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,800
谢谢
Thank you

1034
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,830
嗯，我是乍得。关于你们使用的预构建手势动画的问题
Um , i'm chad . a question about the pre build gesture animations you guys used

1035
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:52,730
你是在对话剧本写好之前还是之后创建的，呃
Did you create them before the dialogue script was written or afterwards , uh

1036
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:56,420
大多数情况下之后是因为，正如我所说，诊断
Most cases afterwards because the , as i said that the diagganis

1037
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,600
我喜欢，我喜欢导演
I like , i like directors

1038
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,917
所以我们有了剧本
So we have the script

1039
00:55:58,917 --> 00:55:59,550
呃
Uh

1040
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:02,110
你也可以，当然要配合
You can also , of course you have to cooperate with the

1041
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,570
呃，四边形设计师和作家一样
Uh , quad designers and like the writers

1042
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,990
但你需要弄清楚你
But you need to figure ou

1043
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,710
如何，你知道的
How to , you know

1044
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:08,390
在 、 、 中 创建此对话

呃，以一种好的方式
Uh , in good way

1046
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:14,322
所以有时这意味着你可以请求一个特殊的 ， 呃 ， 呃 ， 对话动画
So sometimes it means that you can request a special , uh , uh , dialog animatio

1047
00:56:14,322 --> 00:56:17,040
因为没有它真的很难创作
And because like it really very hard to create without it

1048
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,800
但在大多数情况下，他们试图，你知道
But in most cases they tried to , you know

1049
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,720
他们尽可能多地使用，比如，你知道的
They use as much as possible , like , you know

1050
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,180
他们谦虚地做了很多魔术
They do a lot of magic modeously

1051
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:22,720
喜欢，呃
Like , uh

1052
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,000
有时他们从几个手势和智能摄像头
Sometimes they from the only a few gestures and of smart camera

1053
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,620
你知道，嗯，短裤
You know , um , shorts

1054
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,580
他们创造了非常好的表演

1055
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,520
谢谢

1056

非常感谢你，这真的很鼓舞人心
Thank you very much for the for it it's really inspiring

1058
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,270
我的问题也是一样的
My question was along the same lines

1059
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:44,790
但我想知道你是如何组织起来的
But i was wondering how did you manage to organize

1060
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,820
所以有这么多作品
So having so many piece

1061
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,260
并且动画师之间的工作不会太多
and not overwhopping work between animators

1062
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,580
并确保您拥有所需的一切
And making sure that you have everything that you need

1063
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,037
他使用的通用管道是什么
What was the general pipeline that he used

1064
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:57,770
所以 epipeline 非常相似，我向您展示了
So epipeline was very similar that i i showed you

1065
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:02,470
所以就像后来的对话描述一样
So it was like the descript later the the dialogue

1066
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:04,730
所以使用生殖器总是可以创造非常快的
So using the genital can always create very fast

1067
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,290
就像迭代的第一次对话一样
Like the first dialogue of iteration

1068
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,410
所以我们可以把它放在游戏中
So we can quite design is put it into the game

1069
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:09,850
所以我们可以玩，你知道，然后 chec
So we can play , you know , and chec

1070
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,370
它是如何热战和，嗯
How it hot wars and the , um

1071
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,960
他们会是什么样子
How they're going look like with this

1072
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,140
后来挖掘设计师可以，你知道在创造时，嗯
And later the dig designers can , you know on create , um

1073
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,850
视觉部分的决赛
The final of visual parts

1074
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,690
或者他们可以请求像 ， 好的 这样的资产
Or they can request assets like , okay

1075
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,230
我们需要有类似的特效
We need to have like a special effect

1076
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,150
所以请这样做。或者我们需要有特殊的声音或其他东西
So please do it . or we need to have special sounds or something

1077
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,470
所以后来我们有了
So later that we have thi

1078
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,940
而制作人制作人
And that the producer producer for this

1079
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:35,970
你知道，他们收集所有这些小任务
And you know , they collect and all these small task

1080
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,220
并了解并要求他们用于不同的 deparan
And and know and request them for different deparan

1081
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,370
所以基本上它就像一个迭代过程
So basically it's like an iterative process

1082
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,750
你用你所拥有的东西工作，如果你需要什么
You work with what you have and if you need something

1083
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:44,230
是的
Yeah

1084
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:44,390
是的
Yeah

1085
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:44,670
是的
Yeah

1086
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:45,430
我们有很多“是”的
We have a lot of yeah

1087
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,590
你兴高采烈
You have a lot of elations

1088
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:50,490
即使对话不像对话完成了
Even if the dialogues like it's not like the dialogue done

1089
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:51,670
而且它已经遵守了
And it's comply done

1090
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,770
因为即使有组织
Because even with the organization

1091
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,990
您需要返回每种语言并检查是否适用于每种语言
You need to go back for every language and check if for every language

1092
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:57,800
一切都很好
Everything is okay

1093
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,320
所以总是很耗时
So it's always time consuming

1094
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,120
所以有时你需要知道扭转一些东西
So sometimes you need to know twist something

1095
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,450
因为语言版本不同而思考
Think because of the different language version

1096
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:06,560
因为希望每种语言版本具有相同的质量。答案是肯定的
Because would like to have the same quality for for each language version . of course

1097
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,190
是的
Yeah

1098
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,820
所以最终甚至，呃
So it's end up that even , uh

1099
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,710
你可以，你可以有不同的，呃，时间线版本

1100
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,410
部分不同 ， 呃 ， 语言版本

1101
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,330
如果你愿意
If if you want

1102
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,530
所以默认情况下是这样的，像这样
So by defaults like this , like this

1103
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,390
您可以缩放它
You can scale it

1104
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:21,670
但如果你真的想，要，去，去改变它
But if you really want to , to , to change it

1105
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,550
你可以选择说，好吧
There is option that you can say , okay

1106
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,490
例如，对于法语
For example , for french

1107
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:30,100
我想知道在额外的时间里移动安全点旧的。呜呜。详
I would like to know to move safety bit old at extra . uuuh . details

1108
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,180
因为我们，我们没有

1109
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,475
我们不使用 db
We don't use db

1110
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,550
所以这是 、 、 、 、
So this was the , the , the , the

1111
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,780
嗯，来自亚洲的羽毛案例
Um , plumatic case from from asia

00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,640
但在同样的

但在同一个，呃

1114
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,910
同时 .这几乎没有什么好处
The same time . this there are few benefits from this

1115
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:45,690
因为我们可以从演员那里得到真实的表演
Because we can have the real performance from the actors

1116
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:49,857
因此，在某些语言中，您可以自定义让笑话
So in some languages you can have the , the custom letting jokes

1117
00:58:49,857 --> 00:58:52,720
因为你知道这个笑话可以更长，因为它是

1118
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,360
我知道它是不同语言的波兰语
